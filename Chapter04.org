* Introduction

# The next chapter investigates the optimised \CNSM model with more the complex,
# biologically-realistic stimuli involved in amplitude modulation.


# This chapter investigates the output responses of neurons in the \CNSM model,

# # Chapter 3 has
# created optimised parameters based on simple stimuli (tones, noises, and
# clicks).
# This chapter tests the performance of the optimised \CNSM model
# to \AM sounds is
# critical

# To understanding how temporal information is processed and encoded in
# the auditory central nervous system, we need  .

\Gls{AM} is the periodic modulation of the sound amplitude of a carrier
frequency (see Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:def} \citep{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}). It is
a key feature of speech and other biologically relevant sounds
\citep{Bregman:1990}. Investigating \AM coding is a useful way of understanding
how temporal information is processed and encoded in the auditory system. The
\CN is a major processing stage between the \AN and higher auditory centres, and
modelling and numerical analysis of its processes are important ways to develop
insight into its operation.


This chapter presents the \AM coding behaviour of the \CNSM model. It focuses
specifically on the microcircuit's rate and temporal behaviour in response to
sinusoidal \AM stimuli. The outputs of the \CNSM model are the \TS cells, which
provide a robust spectral representation of auditory information and enhanced
coding of temporal information, especially the pitch in complex environments
\citep{KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}.
# The \CNSM model contains three inhibitory interneurons, each controlling the
# rate and temporal response of \TS cells.
Despite rate saturation of \ANFs\space -- the input to the \CNSM model cells --
their ability to code temporal information is not disabled.
# The effects of intrinsic cell properties in the cells of the \CNSM model
The optimal coding of \AM is still provided across the network, more
specifically in lateral sidebands around the edges of the response area.


# The analysis study does not include \AM parameters modulation
# depth, and variationin \fc are not included in this study.
The analysis in this chapter investigates the responses of the \CNSM model to
variation in sound level and \fm using measures of
envelope synchronisation and average rate. The analysis measures of \AM
encoding are introduced in the next section.
# Measures used to assess the neural output
# to \AM stimuli and the current knowledge of responses in the \AN and neurons of
# the \CNSM model to AM.

Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:def} shows the general properties of a sinusoidal \AM stimuli and the
response of an \AN model filterbank. The general formula for an \AM
tone is
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}\label{eq:AMformula}
s(t) = [1 + m \sin(2\pi{}f_{\mathrm{m}}t)] \sin (2\pi{}f_{\mathrm{c}}t)
\end{equation}
\noindent
#+END_LaTeX
where /m/ is the modulation height. A portion of an \AM stimulus is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:def}A, which is a 100\% modulated sinusoidal \AM tone
($m=1$), with \fc 2 kHz and \fm of 100 Hz. When transformed to the
frequency-domain, the frequency components of an \AM tone are a dominant spike
at \fc and two components \fc $\pm$ \fm with half the height of the component at
\fc (Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:def}B). In the \CNSM model, the
\citet{ZilanyCarney:2010} \AN model was processed using an \AM tone (150 msec 65
dB \SPL) with 100 frequency channels from 200 Hz to 40 kHz (centre frequencies
determined by the cat Greenwood function, see Section \ref{sec:Ch2:Tonotopic})
and 20 \HSR fibres per frequency channel. Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:def}C shows a
portion of the spike time histogram of 2000 \HSR\space \ANFs to a 150 msec \AM
stimulus as shown in Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:def}A. A \FFT was
applied to the all-unit histogram (excluding the first 20 msec) and a spike time
histogram of the unit with \CF closest to \fc. The peaks in the all-unit
\FFT spectrum (arrows in Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:def}D) are the \fm (100
Hz) and its harmonics. The frequency components of \HSR fibres with \CF closest
to \fc (dotted line in Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:def}D) show synchronisation to \fc,
which is typical of low \CF\space \ANFs.

** Temporal Measures of Amplitude \protect{Modulation}

Temporal information in neural outputs is measured using the
\SI (also known synchronisation coefficient or vector strength)
\citep{GoldbergBrown:1969,ShannonZengEtAl:1995,MardiaJupp:1999,JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}.
\SI measures phase-locking relative to the \fm or envelope of the
stimuli.
# In this analysis, the \SI values were combined for each modulation
# frequency to create the \tMTF.
The \SI measure was calculated 20 msec after the
onset of the stimulus:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:SI}
  \mathsf{S} = \frac{1}{N} \sqrt{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} \cos \theta_i \right)^2 + \left(\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} \sin \theta_i \right)^2 }
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
\noindent where $N$ is the number of spikes
\citep{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004,KajikawaHackett:2005}. Each spike was treated as
a vector of unit length with phase $\theta_i$ between 0 and $2\pi$ measured as the spike
time modulo of the stimulus period, $1/\fm$. Perfect synchronisation will give
\SI equal to 1 and occurs when all spikes lock to the same phase. An \SI measure
of zero occurs when spikes have a uniform phase distribution. Bi-phasic or
multi-phasic responses (i.e.\space phase-locking to harmonics of the
fundamental) degrade the \SI value but the temporal information pertaining to
\fm is still retained for higher auditory centres. Further measures of temporal
information, i.e.\space phase-locking to any frequency, is performed using a
\FFT as in Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:def}.

# *** The Rayleigh Test

The statistical test used to verify the non-uniformity of circular data is the
Rayleigh test
\citep{ShannonZengEtAl:1995,Fisher:1996,Zar:1999,Jammalamadaka:2001}. The null
hypothesis states that the population of phases is uniformly distributed around
the circle. This test assumes the distribution is unimodal around a particular
phase. \SI and the Rayleigh test are dependent on the number of spikes and the
resolution of the spike recordings (in simulations this is the integration time
step). For \SI values below 0.1, a high spike count is required to obtain a
statistically significant result.
# The Rayleigh test is equivalent to a Chi-squared test in uniform
# data. In neuroscience the Rayleigh test was originally calculated using
#  $2N(\mathsf{SI})^2$ \citep{Mardia:1972}.
# The critical p-values for this Rayleigh
# test were 5.991 for \alpha = 0.05 and 13.816 for \alpha = 0.001
# \citep{ShannonZengEtAl:1995,MardiaJupp:1999}.
The p-value for the Rayleigh test is computed using the
approximation by \citet[p.~617]{Zar:1999}:[fn:: The code was converted for use in NEURON from the CircStat Matlab Toolbox \citep{Berens:2009}.]
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SIp}
p = \exp\left(\sqrt{1+4N+4(N^2-R^2)-(1+2N)}\right)
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
\noindent where $R=N\times\mathrm{S}$. In this analysis, \SI and Rayleigh tests were
also calculated using a \FFT of the period histogram to verify
the procedure.

# (Further analysis of
# the critical values see W. Rhode's analysis on the vector
# strength and Rayleigh statistic[fn::  [[http://www.neurophys.wisc.edu/comp/docs/not011/not011.html]].] )

#  A more recent study looking at another \SI verification statistic has been
#  published (need to look into this).

** Amplitude Modulation Coding in the Auditory Pathway

The auditory pathway transforms the high-fidelity, metabolically intensive,
temporal-place encoding of \AM signals in the \AN into a more efficient
rate-place encoding in the \IC and higher auditory nervous system centres
\citep{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}. Temporal coding of \AM relies on the precise
timing of spikes relative to the envelope of the stimulus, otherwise called
phase locking or synchrony. Rate coding of \AM signals can take the form of
pure rate-place, rate-responder or feature-based encoding. Pure rate-place
encoding is where neurons encode the stimulus' energy spectrum in their
receptive field through simple firing rate changes. In rate-responder encoding,
neurons fire in each envelope cycle and as the cycle gets shorter the rate
increases up to a certain limit - this is common in low \CF units in the \AN and
\CN, and onset units (octopus cells) in the \PVCN. Specialised feature-based
rate encoding encodes particular features of \AM signals, especially \fm in \IC
neurons.


To investigate the response of \CNSM model neurons to \AM tones, we tested
variations in sound level and variations in \fm.
The \fz response illustrates the encoding with respect to the stimulus sound
level, typically measured with a fixed \fm and a carrier frequency at a neuron's
\CF.
# effects of synchrony and rate to the stimulus  envelope (\fm)
\Gls{MTF} is used in auditory neuroscience to measure the output of neurons in
response to variation in \fm. The rate \MTF (\rMTF) measures the output in
terms of firing rate. Temporal encoding of modulation, \tMTF, is measured using
\SI at each \fm. Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:RG94MTF} shows the filter characteristics
of low-pass and band-pass \tMTF responses \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994}. Low-pass
filters have a stable \SI response to low \fm stimuli that degrades when \fm
increases above the corner frequency. Band-pass filters increase their
synchrony to the \fm envelope to a peak \SI response, called its \BMF, after
which their synchrony deteriorates. The inset figures in Figure
\ref{fig:Ch4:RG94MTF} provide more information on the nature of the \SI
statistic. A half-wave rectified sinusoidal plot, where spikes occur in only
half of the cycle period around a single phase, has an \SI of 0.784. The
modulation envelope, where spikes occur across the whole period with one
dominant phase, has a theoretical \SI of 0.5.

Temporal information is critical for vocal communication in the mammalian
auditory system. In humans, \AM is essential for distinguishing vowels and for
segregation of streams of sounds with different fundamental frequencies
\citep{Bregman:1990}. Firing rate is an efficient way of indicating a specific
quality or stimulus feature, as shown in other sensory pathways. Rate coding in
the individual \ANFs and spectral coding across all \ANFs give a poor
representation of modulated signals
\citep{Frisina:1983,JorisYin:1992,JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}. Neural encoding and
transformations of sound-envelope information in the \CN and higher auditory
centres have been studied extensively due to the fundamental importance of
temporal information in animal communications (see reviews
\citet{FrisinaWaltonEtAl:1994} and \citet{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}).

The \rMTF of the HSR ANF unit is an all-pass filter and saturates at 230 spikes per second. The \tMTF is a low pass filter at 30 dB \SPL and strength of synchronisation reduces dramatically with increase in sound intensity  (Sync. Coeff. is the same as \SI).   Figure reproduced from \citet{RhodeGreenberg:1994}. }
 [[../VowelProcessingChapter/gfx/RG94-AN_MTF.png]]


The temporal coding of \AM in auditory neurons uses fine timing of spikes locked
to the stimulus envelope. Individual \ANFs can encode temporal information of
\CF tones up to 5 kHz and \AM tones up to 2 kHz. Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:RG94_AN}
shows the characteristic rate and temporal \MTF response of an \HSR\space \ANF to
on-\CF\space \AM tones. The \HSR\space \ANF rate responses are flat and saturate at
moderate sound levels. The temporal \MTF response in \HSR\space \ANFs is low-pass and
moderate in maximum synchrony, and the synchronisation deteriorates with
increasing sound intensity.
The \citet{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009} \AN model has shown accurate replication of experimental \AM responses in cat \ANFs \citep{JorisYin:1992}
including synchronisation changes to modulation depth, sound level and modulation frequency.

\glsunset{GABA}

The encoding of \AM tones in the mammalian \CN is well documented
\citep{Frisina:1984,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990a,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990,Frisina:2001,RhodeGreenberg:1994}.
Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:RG94Chopper} shows the typical temporal \MTFs of \TS cells
(\ChS and \ChT) in cats \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994}. Sustained choppers are
characterised as changing from low-pass \tMTF to band-pass \tMTF with increasing
sound levels. Transient choppers have a greater enhancement in synchronisation
to the modulation envelope and are more robust to increases in sound level. All
chopper units have a reduced \tMTF cut-off frequency due to slower membrane
dynamics and integration of inputs. The variations in \BMFs in \TS cells are
possibly due to a resonance in either their neuron's intrinsic oscillation
frequency \citep{WiegrebeMeddis:2004,ManisMolitorEtAl:2003} or recurrent network
connections between other \TS cells
\citep{BahmerLangner:2006,ManorRinzelEtAl:1997}. The temporal encoding of \AM
tones in \CN neurons is preserved in noise, but like pure \AM tones,
deteriorates at high stimulus intensities
\citep{JorisYin:1992,FrisinaKarcichEtAl:1996}. Temporal encoding in \CN units
is also greatly affected by changes in \GABA and glycinergic synapses
\citep{CasparyPalombiEtAl:2002,BackoffShadduckEtAl:1999}.

Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:ANCNSummary} shows the simplified temporal \fz and \MTF
responses in \ANFs and the comparative transformation of temporal responses in
chopper units \citep{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}. The general enhancement of
synchronisation to the stimulus envelope aids in the translation of this
information to higher auditory centres. Conversion of temporal MTFs from
low-pass filters to band-pass filters also aids in \BMF selectivity and pitch
sensitivity in the central nucleus of the \IC
\citep{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004,DAngeloSterbingEtAl:2003,ZhangKelly:2003,CasparyPalombiEtAl:2002,LangnerAlbertEtAl:2002,KrishnaSemple:2000,DepireuxShamma:1996}.
The robustness of \AM coding to sound level is important for loud conversational
speech and speech in noisy environments. The \AN and \CNSM models encode sound
from one ear and the spectro-temporal processing performed in the network is
important for detecting pitch, variations in phase and harmonic differences
\citep{MillmanGreenEtAl:2003,CarlyonShamma:2003}.

* Methods
** Stimulus

The stimulus generation followed Rhode and Greenberg's encoding of \AM in cats
\citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994}. \AM signals were generated by modulating a carrier
signal of specified frequency, amplitude, and phase by a sinusoidal modulator
with amplitude and phase equal to that of the carrier (100\% modulation). The
\fm ranged from 50 to 1200 Hz and was stepped up by 50 Hz. The \fc was set to 4.513 kHz, the central channel \CF of the \CNSM model.
# lected
# from each of the \CFs of the exemplar \TS cell models (3.8, 8.9 or 12.3 kHz) in
# Chapter \ref{sec:ModelChapter}.

** Simulations and Analysis

The simulations were performed using the neural simulation package [[latex:progname][NEURON]]
\citep{CarnevaleHines:2006}, as described in Chapter
\ref{sec:MethodsChapter}. [[latex:progname][NEURON]]'s Crank-Nicholson integration method was used
in the simulations with time step 0.05 msec, stimulus duration 150 msec and
total duration 170 msec. Stimuli were repeated 50 times and the spike times of
all \ANF and \CN units recorded.

To avoid onset adaptation effects in auditory neurons, simulations or recordings
preferred long stimuli so that the units' responses were in a steady-state.
Rate analysis in each neuron was calculated from the average firing rate from 20
ms after onset to the end of the stimulus. Temporal analysis used the same
post-stimulus spikes in the calculation of \SI and the Rayleigh statistics.
# between 20 msec and the end of the stimulus.

** CNSM model

Table \ref{tab:AMModelSummary} shows the summary of the model used in this
study. As described in Chapter \ref{sec:MethodsChapter}, the Nordlie approach
to reproducible neural network simulations \citep{NordlieGewaltigEtAl:2009} was
followed. The cell types of the \CNSM model (\GLG cells, \DS cells, \TV cells,
and the chopper subtypes of \TS cells) and network parameters of the
microcircuit were developed and optimised in Chapter \ref{sec:ModelChapter} to
fit the experimentally observed behaviour of each of the cell types in the
model.

* Results

** Responses to Changes in Stimulus Intensity

Sinusoidal \AM tones with fixed carrier and modulation frequencies (\fc = 4.513
kHz and \fm = 150 Hz) were presented to the \CNSM model to measure the \fz
response across the model's cell types. The \fz response illustrates the
effects of synchrony to the stimulus envelope (\fm) with respect to the stimulus
sound level, typically measured with the \fc at a neuron's \CF. The stimulus
paradigm is similar to experimental methods; however, the \CNSM model allows the
inspection of a whole network of units with different \CFs. The fixed \fm in
this study, 150 Hz, is within the range of human speech fundamental frequencies
(women 150-300 Hz, men 75-150 Hz). The \fc is not in the human speech range
(most speech is between 200--3400 Hz with other relevant information up to 8
kHz) but is in the human audibility range (64 Hz to 23 kHz)
\citep{Bregman:1990}. This study uses the cat \AN model which has an audibility
range up to 64 kHz \citep{SimmonsPopperEtAl:2002,FayPopper:1994}. The carrier
frequency of 4.5 kHz was chosen to be close enough to the speech range and away
from low frequency harmonics of \fm which interfere with the lateral side-bands

described in Table \ref{tab:AMModelSummary}v. Spiking outputs 20 msec after the
stimulus onset were used to calculate the firing rate and \SI of each of the

The temporal \fz response maps for each cell in the \CNSM model are shown in
Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:fzero}. Each column represents a single unit's \fz
response to the AM stimulus, where, traversing on the y axis from bottom to top,
the stimulus level varies from 0 to 90 dB \SPL. Each row in the \fz response
maps represents the temporal response (\SI) of units in adjacent frequency
channels to a single presentation of the stimulus to the \CNSM model at a fixed
intensity. The rate level response maps for the same stimuli are
shown in Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:fzerorate}.

Figures \ref{fig:Ch4:fzero}A and B show the \fz response map of the \HSR and
\LSR cell types in the \CNSM model. The rate level response maps of \ANFs are
shown in Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:fzerorate}A and B. \HSR\space \ANFs have a
non-linear \fz response, with \SI peaking around 0.6 at intensities 20-30 dB
above threshold, then reducing to below 0.2 for intensities 60 dB above rate
threshold \citep{JorisYin:1992}. Loss of \fz response in \ANFs is typically due
to saturation at the inner hair cell to \AN synapse or the encoding of higher
harmonics rather than the envelope. The \citet{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009} \AN model
was designed to replicate \AM responses and the \fz response. The V-like \fz
response map of the \HSR fibres (Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:fzero}A) shows the strong
non-linear temporal behaviour at each frequency channel surrounding the \fc.
# at high
# intensities when the carrier frequency is centred on a unit's \CF.
For the on-\CF unit (4.513 kHz), the peak \SI was 0.775 at 15 dB \SPL and then
subsequently fell below the Rayleigh test of statistical significance (p-value
$<0.05$) when the unit reached maximum firing rate at 40 dB \SPL. Adjacent
network channels showed similar behaviour with an adjustment in rise and
fall of \SI based on excitation from the cochlea filter. These results are
similar to the model results presented by \citet{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}. The
peak \SI in the map was 0.777 by unit 84 (CF 20.7 kHz) at 90 dB at approximately
50\% of maximum firing rate.

In \LSR\space \ANFs (Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:fzero}B) the \fz response map
maintained moderate temporal information throughout the response area. The \fz
response of the on-\CF unit had its peak temporal response at rate threshold then
slowly reduced to a moderate temporal response at high intensity. The rate level
map is the exact opposite (Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:fzerorate}B) with the peak
response on-\CF at high sound levels. Across frequency channels and intensities,
active units near the edges of the response area provided high (around 0.8 \SI)
temporal information. At high intensities, units with \CFs near the carrier
frequency maintained moderate ($0.5 - 0.6$ \SI) temporal information that was
lacking in the \HSR units in this area.

The rate \fz response map of \GLG cells in Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:fzerorate}C was
broader and had a higher firing rate output relative to \LSR inputs. \GLG cells
receive a majority of their inputs from \LSR fibres that have high temporal
information throughput across their active response area (Figure
\ref{fig:Ch4:fzero}B). Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:fzero}C shows the \GLG cells'
temporal \fz response map. The \GLG cells' temporal encoding performance was
moderate near the edges of their response area and deteriorated at high \SPL to
levels below 0.3 \SI. The diminished temporal information is a result of the
smoothing kernel in the \GLG neural model. Despite this, the \GLG cell model was
still capable of passing temporal information to other cells in the microcircuit
(mean SI = 0.52, p$<0.05$); however, the \GLG cells' monotonic rate-level response
shows that they are very good at encoding stimulus intensity in \AM tones and
using their slower GABAergic synapses to control excitability within the \CNSM
model.

Figures \ref{fig:Ch4:fzero}D and \ref{fig:Ch4:fzerorate}D show the \DS cells'
temporal and rate \fz response maps, respectively. Both the rate and temporal
responses had a broad activation and the temporal information was enhanced at
every level-CF point on the map relative to \HSR and \LSR\space \ANFs.
\Gls{OnC} units recorded from the dorsal acoustic stria in cats have shown high
\SI maintained above 0.8 up to 60 dB \SPL then sloping down to 0.6 at 80 dB \SPL
\citep{JorisSmith:1998}. The on-\CF unit peaked at 20 dB \SPL with \SI of 0.937
and steadily declined with increasing level to 0.443 \SI at 90 dB \SPL. The
lowest point in the \DS cell \fz response map was 0.417 at 90 dB \SPL (unit 71,
\CF 11.7) and the mean for all points below 0.05 in the Rayleigh test was 0.77
\SI. The maximum phase response for the \DS cell model (results not shown) was
linear over \SPL similar to experimental results \citep{JorisSmith:1998}.

The \fz response of \TV cells (Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:fzero}E) shows an enhanced
temporal response but due to the cell's non-linear rate response (Figure
\ref{fig:Ch4:fzerorate}E) its activity was only effective at sound levels below
50 dB SPL.
# High \SI values (close to 1) near the rate
# threshold boundary occur where \HSR units are at their peak in Figure
# \ref{fig:Ch4:fzero}A.
\TV cells receive strong inhibition from \DS cells, especially at higher sound
levels. At lower sound levels, \TV cells process only \HSR and \LSR\space \ANF inputs.
This implicates intrinsic mechanisms in the \TV cell model and integration of
\ANF inputs within the dynamic range that contribute to this enhancement.
# contribute to a high input resistance at \RMP. The lower leak potential
# (\Eleak) in the \TV cell model also increases the difference between \RMP and
# \AP threshold. These mechanisms remove the DC component of uncorrelated inputs
# and enhances the AC component of \HSR and \LSR excitatory inputs.
# In the centre of the \TV cell temporal \fz response map (Figure
# \ref{fig:Ch4:fzero}E, units with \CF near \fc at high stimulus intensities), \SI
# values deteriorate with no firing. At low \SPL, \HSR inputs to the \TV cell model are not
# temporally significant but the combination of \LSR excitation and \DS cell
# inhibition with high temporal precision enhances the \TV cells to encode
# temporally relevant information to cells in the microcircuit.


Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:fzero}F shows the \fz response map of \ChS subtype \TS cell
models. \ChS model cells receive inputs from all the other cell types in the
\CNSM model with greater excitation relative to the other chopper subtypes. The
\ChS model's \fz response map has a narrower V-shape compared to the \HSR
response map with elevated temporal responses over the whole map (mean 0.70, min
0.366, max 0.973). The \fz response of the unit with \CF at \fc has a sharp
rise in \SI at rate threshold then falls to 0.216 \SI at 50 dB \SPL, and
steadily rises to 0.800 \SI at 90 dB \SPL. The characteristic robustness of the
\TS cell on-CF \fz response, summarised in Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:ANCNSummary}, is
appropriately matched by the \ChS model with strong enhancement of temporal
information at high \SPL. The rate response (Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:fzero}F) is
not stable at sound levels above 60 dB (as shown by the white patches in the
temporal response) where the firing rate is low. The inhibition to the \ChS
model is stronger for units with \CFs below \fc. Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:fzero}G
shows the \fz response map of \ChTone subtype \TS cell models. The strong
firing rate after threshold is equally matched by the strong inhibition at high
\SPL on the \ChTone model, seen in its rate-level response map (Figure
\ref{fig:Ch4:fzerorate}G). The \fz responses of the final \TS cell in the \CNSM
model, \ChTtwo, were more robust in its rate response (Figure
\ref{fig:Ch4:fzerorate}H) with enhanced synchronisation in the lateral sidebands
(Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:fzero}H). The on-CF \ChTtwo unit peaked at 15 dB \SPL with
\SI 0.873 before falling to 0.35 with some irregularities at higher sound levels.

** Responses to Changes in Modulation Frequency

The figures in this section show the rate and temporal \MTF response maps,
across the entire network, of the \CNSM model to an \AM tone with carrier
frequency 4.513 kHz. Modulation frequency ranged from 50 to 1200 Hz in 50 Hz
steps and the \SPL was set to four appropriate levels (20, 40, 60 and 80 dB SPL).
Each figure shows the \rMTF on the left and \tMTF on the right. The \SI values
were masked in white if the Rayleigh coefficient was not statistically
significant (p-value $< 0.05$).

# The sound level of each stimulus

Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:HSRMTF} shows the rate and temporal \MTF maps of \HSR\space
\ANFs to \AM tones with $\fc=4.513$ kHz. \HSR fibres saturate to pure \CF tones
at 40 dB \SPL, whereas their response to \AM tones was dependent on the carrier
and modulating frequencies. Figures \ref{fig:Ch4:HSRMTF}A, C and E show the
average rate response to \AM tones of varying \fm at stimulus intensities 80, 60
and 40 dB \SPL, respectively. The spread of excitation is consistent across \fm
at each intensity. For \HSR units with \CFs above \fc, rate increases with \fm
and peaks around 600 Hz. The rate peak occurs in unit 75 (CF 14 kHz) with rate
30\% greater than the unit closest to \fc (\CF 4.513 kHz).

Temporal information in \HSR units at each of the corresponding stimulus
intensities (Figures \ref{fig:Ch4:HSRMTF}B, D and F) is strongest near the edges
of excitation with a low-pass \tMTF extending beyond 1.2 kHz (the maximum range
\fm is this study). At 80 dB \SPL (Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:HSRMTF}B), units with
\CFs above the centre channel had mean \SI of 0.75 with a peak of 0.814. Moving
toward \fc, the \HSR units lose low modulation frequency information to become
band-pass \tMTF filters until 7 kHz where the salient temporal information
ceases. Units between 7 kHz and 3.8 kHz (two frequency channels below the
centre unit) show a rapid deterioration of temporal information despite being at
the centre of the stimulus' energy. Below the centre channel, band-pass \tMTF
responses increase in mean and peak values further away from the centre with the
apex at unit 39 (CF 2.67 kHz, mean \SI = 0.608, max \SI  = 0.785).
Synchronisation for units below the centre channel at high \fm showed anomalous behaviour
due to the low frequency tail in the \AN tuning curve and harmonics of the \fm.

The \tMTF response observed at 60 dB \SPL (Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:HSRMTF}D) looks
similar to the 80 dB \SPL response with a reduced number of frequency channels
reflecting the reduced rate excitation range in Figure
\ref{fig:Ch4:HSRMTF}C. The dominant frequency channels below (unit 44, \CF 3.4
kHz, mean \SI 0.666, max \SI 0.805) and above (unit 61, \CF 7.47 kHz, mean \SI
0.741, max \SI 0.787) are at the border of rate threshold, showing a gradual
increase of temporal information in units further from the centre \CF unit. At
40 dB \SPL, the two salient information bands begin to merge as the range of
excited frequency channels gets closer to the centre \CF.

\Gls{LSR} fibres' rate responses to \AM tones were non-saturating and centred on
the \fc (Figures \ref{fig:Ch4:LSRMTF}A, C and E). The \rMTF of the on-\CF unit
was typically low-pass but did fluctuate at modulation frequencies above 400 Hz
for each stimulus intensity. Figures \ref{fig:Ch4:LSRMTF}B, D and F show that
\LSR fibres in the \AN model were better at encoding temporal information than
\HSR\space \ANFs. This has been observed previously in cat \ANFs
\citep{JorisYin:1992}. The low-pass \tMTF is typical of \ANFs and can be seen
at each stimulus intensity, particularly in units above the \fc. The \fm cut-off
frequency for \LSR units was beyond the 1.2 kHz range used in this study. At 80
dB \SPL (Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:LSRMTF}B), \LSR units had higher mean and peak \SI
values than \HSR units (mean 0.74, max 0.937) above \fc and the low-pass \tMTF
response was maintained. For the on-\CF unit (unit 50, \CF 4.5 kHz), its mean
\SI 0.415 with a peak of 0.673 was the lowest of all salient temporal response
channels. Below \fc, an unusual temporal response at high \fm may relate to the
rate fluctuations in Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:LSRMTF}A or a reduction in the \fm
cut-off frequency. The high gain, low-pass \tMTF responses were observed at 60
and 40 dB \SPL stimulus intensities (Figures \ref{fig:Ch4:LSRMTF}D and F).


Figures \ref{fig:Ch4:RG94ANF}A and B show the on-\CF rate and temporal \MTF
responses of \HSR\space \ANF experimental data \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994}. All
stimulus levels but the lowest (20 dB \SPL) showed saturated rate responses in
the on-\CF\space \rMTF response of the \HSR\space \ANF (Figure
\ref{fig:Ch4:RG94ANF}C). The sensitivity to \fm at 20 dB \SPL shows the typical
rate-following characteristic by phase-locking to each cycle and following the
increase in the number of cycles. Temporal information was also more
substantial at 20 dB for the on-\CF\space \HSR fibres' \tMTF response (Figure
\ref{fig:Ch4:RG94ANF}D). As shown in Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:HSRMTF}, the
on-\CF\space \tMTF response becomes insignificant with increasing sound level.
The \LSR\space \ANF model's rate responses increased with sound level but were
insensitive to changes in \fm with flat \rMTF responses (Figure
\ref{fig:Ch4:RG94ANF}E). The on-\CF\space \tMTF responses of simulated
\LSR\space \ANFs were low-pass and linearly decreased with increasing sound
levels but still maintained moderate temporal information (Figure
\ref{fig:Ch4:RG94ANF}F). The irregular errors in \HSR and \LSR\space \ANF
responses at high \SPL and high \fm are an artefact of the
\citet{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009} \AN model.

Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:GMTF} shows the \GLG cell rate and temporal \MTF across the
whole network to \AM tones centred at 4.5 kHz. The \GLG cell model's \rMTF
on-\CF was typically flat or low-pass, mimicking the rate behaviour of \LSR
fibres, its primary source of excitation. The \rMTF maps of \GLG cell responses,
Figures \ref{fig:Ch4:GMTF}A, C and E, show a wider activation of units compared
to \LSR fibres (Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:LSRMTF}) with no discernible saturation. The
\GLG cell units had a flat \rMTF response for all sound levels, indicating \GLG
cells provide consistent spike output independent of changes in \fm.


The temporal information contained in the \tMTFs of \GLG cell units was
diminished relative to \LSR fibres. The smoothing filter used in the \GLG cell
model contributes to the reduction of temporal information, particularly the
cut-off frequency. The peak temporal responses of the \GLG cell model occurred
at low \fm with a rapid drop off in \SI around 350 Hz. The on-\CF unit had a
flat low-pass \tMTF before its Rayleigh test dropped below the threshold. Its
mean \SI from 50 to 1200 Hz (excluding values when the Rayleigh test was below
threshold) was 0.39, 0.275, 0.146, and 0.11
at stimulus intensities 20, 40, 60,
and 80 dB \SPL, respectively. The cut-off frequency for the on-\CF unit was
consistently at 250 Hz, after which the \GLG cells output was unsynchronised to
the envelope of the stimulus. At the highest intensity, 80 dB \SPL in Figure
\ref{fig:Ch4:GMTF}B, units furthest from the \fc and active had greater
temporal information with the maximum \SI value
call_MTFmaxpos(spl="80",cell="3")[ :results replace raw ]. With firing rates
near threshold in high \SI regions and the low cut-off frequencies, the temporal
effects of \GLG cells on other neurons in the \CNSM model are predominantly at
low \fm.

The broad \CF range of \ANF inputs to \DS units allows for a greater likelihood
of coincidence detection and an increase in synchronisation relative to the
inputs. The rate responses of \DS units (Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:DSMTF}) were wider
for 40 and 60 \SPL stimuli relative to the narrow band \TS units. For 40 dB
\SPL stimuli, most \DS units had a band-pass \rMTF. For higher \SPL, a greater
number of spikes occured between 100 and 500 Hz for units above \CF (band-pass
\rMTF), but the rest of the active units remained stable (low-pass
\rMTF). Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:DSonCF}A shows the consistent linear increase in
rate \MTF responses at low \fm, a peak between 300-400 Hz and falling off to a
stable rate at high \fm. This behaviour is called "rate-responder" due to the
linear increase in firing-rate being dictated to by shortening of the \fm
envelope period. This is similar to ideal onset units (octopus cells) in the
\PVCN but the corner- and cut-off frequencies of the \DS cell's \rMTF are
typically lower.

The temporal responses of \DS units were predominantly band-pass, with higher
\SI values than \ANFs. For lower \SPL, the responses were consistent across
active units with a falling cut-off frequency with falling \CF. For high \SPL,
the \DS units were divided along the central channel. The central unit (Figure

The rate and temporal responses of \TV units (Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:TVMTF}) showed
the non-linear effects of strong inhibition from \DS cells. \TS and \TV units
received similar \ANF inputs, but the inhibition limited the activity at low
sound level and then to a narrow range at higher \SPL. The temporal responses
of \TV units had enhanced synchronisation and sharper cut-off. The outer edges
of active units provided the best temporal response with little to no temporal
information at the \fc units. The rate \MTF responses on the on-\CF\space \TV cell in
Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:TVonCF}A showed a marked drop in spike output after 20 dB
\SPL. This non-linearity in \TV cell responses to \AM tones reflects the
inconclusive status of the relevant experimental data
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,NeuertVerheyEtAl:2004,ZhaoLiang:1997,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990}.

Where significant, the temporal \MTF responses of \TV cells were either low-pass
or band-pass typically at low sound levels. With firing rates in stimuli
above 40 dB \SPL, the temporal responses of all \TV cell's in Figure
\ref{fig:Ch4:TVMTF} and the on-\CF\space \TV cell in Figure
\ref{fig:Ch4:TVonCF}B show irregular temporal information.
The maximum SI values in the on-\CF\space \TV cell were moderately
synchronised (
call_MTFmax_onCF(spl="20",cell="1")[ :results replace raw ]) 
at 20 dB \SPL and decreased to a stable level and higher intensities (
call_MTFmax_onCF(spl="40",cell="1")[ :results replace raw ],

call_MTFmax_onCF(spl="80",cell="1")[ :results replace raw ] for 40, 60 and 80 dB
\SPL, respectively).
# 0.945 (\fm = 100 Hz),
# 0.826 (\fm = 150 Hz),
# 0.713 (\fm = 250 Hz)
# and 0.704 (\fm = 250 Hz).
# 20 dB: SI = call _ MTFmaxpos(spl="20",cell="2")[ :results replace raw ] 0.935 at \CF=11.7 kHz and \fm=100 Hz;

# 80 dB call _ MTFmaxpos(spl="80",cell="2")[ :results replace raw ] 0.874 at \CF=21.7 kHz and \fm=100 Hz).
The \TV units below the central channel had
stronger synchronisation for high sound levels (maximum \SI at 80 dB \SPL 
call_MTFmaxpos(spl="80",cell="1")[ :results replace raw ]
and 60 dB \SPL maximum \SI call_MTFmaxpos(spl="60",cell="1")[ :results replace raw ]).
The maximum unit across all \TV cells at lower intensities had a \CF above the central channel
(40 dB \SPL maximum \SI call_MTFmaxpos(spl="40",cell="1")[ :results replace raw ],
20 dB \SPL maximum \SI call_MTFmaxpos(spl="20",cell="1")[ :results replace raw ]).

The central channel had corner-frequencies less than 500 Hz (Figure
\ref{fig:Ch4:TVonCF}B), indicating a limitation in the intrinsic cell properties
that integrate ANF inputs or strong phasic inhibition for this input modulation.
# For the 20 dB \SPL stimuli shown in Figure
# \ref{fig:Ch4:TVonCF}B, the \TV cell's \BMF of the band-pass filter at 150 Hz had
# \SI of 0.964, a strongly synchronised response from a unit with a high firing
# rate. The \BMF shifted to 350 Hz at 40 dB SPL, however the firing rate was
# greatly diminished.
The low firing rate and few temporally active \TV cell units above 40 dB \SPL but shows a neural group that is
strongly inhibited across the network primarily from \DS cells.

Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:CSMTF} shows the final \MTF responses of the \ChS type \TS
units in the network. The spread of excitation in \ChS units was narrow around
the central channel, with greater excitation above \CF around $\fm=300$ Hz. For
higher sound levels, the spread of excitation was wider but the rate was
steadier for each stimuli. The significant features of the temporal responses
in the right of the figure are the very poor synchronisation in the central
channel and dominant synchronous responses at the outer edge of excitation. For
40 dB \SPL, most active units showed a band-pass \tMTF; however, the dominant
units above \CF had low-pass \tMTFs. For 60 dB \SPL, most
active units showed band-pass \MTFs except for the central units, which showed
limited results or a low-pass \MTF. The maximum \SI values in the on-\CF\space \ChS 
model were strongly synchronised and decreased with increasing \SPL (
call_MTFmax_onCF(spl="20",cell="0")[ :results replace raw ],
call_MTFmax_onCF(spl="40",cell="0")[ :results replace raw ],

call_MTFmax_onCF(spl="80",cell="0")[ :results replace raw ]  for intensities 20, 40, 60 and 80 dB \SPL, respectively).
 Outermost active units (above and below
\fc) had the highest synchronisation across the \TS cell population, similar to
\HSR and \LSR excitatory input responses and the phasic inhibitory inputs from
\GLG and \DS cells.

Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:ChopperONCFMTF} shows the on-\CF unit rate and temporal
\MTF responses of the three \TS cell model subtypes that are otherwise hidden in
the \MTF response maps. Figures \ref{fig:Ch4:ChopperONCFMTF}A and B show the
\ChS model's responses from the \rMTF and \tMTF response maps in Figure
\ref{fig:Ch4:CSMTF}. The on-\CF\space unit's \rMTFs (Figure
\ref{fig:Ch4:ChopperONCFMTF}A) are all-pass at 60 and 80 dB SPL. The on-CF response at 20 dB \SPL was band-pass (\BMF = 150 Hz) up to 500 Hz
where the \ChS model follows the input response of the on-\CF\space HSR unit (Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:RG94ANF}C).

The non-linearity in the \tMTFs at 40 and 60 dB
contrasts with the similarity of the 20 and 80 dB responses (high \SI at low \fms
and a \BMF at 350 Hz).

The \citet{RhodeGreenberg:1994} sustained choppers in Figures
\ref{fig:Ch4:RG94Chopper}A and B had similar band-pass \tMTF responses to 
the \ChS model (Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:ChopperONCFMTF}B).
The \SI of the \BMF in the on-\CF \ChTone model decreased from a peak at 20 
dB \SPL (
call_MTFmax_onCF(spl="20",cell="0",Ch="T1")[ :results replace raw ]) before degrading
the \SI value and increasing the \BMF (

Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:CToneMTF} shows the \MTF response of the \ChTone subtype \TS
cell. The rate response of the \ChTone model is low-pass and is greatly
diminished due to its mixture of strong inhibitory inputs. The low firing rate
is not visible at higher \fm, but can be seen in the range of activated units in
the \tMTF maps. The temporal \MTF response maps of the \ChTone model have a
high degree of synchrony to the envelope and cut-off frequencies above 1200 Hz.
The mean synchronisation of the on-\CF unit was very high (mean 0.713, 0.771,
0.721, 0.79) across the range of levels tested (20, 40, 60, and 80 dB \SPL). The
filter characteristics of the on-\CF unit changed from band-pass at 40 and 60 dB
\SPL (Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:CToneMTF}D and F) to low-pass at 80 dB \SPL (Figure

Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:CTtwoMTF} shows the \MTF responses of the \ChTtwo model of
the \TS cell. The \ChTtwo model's \rMTF responses were similar the \ChTone
model, with the central units having moderate firing rates for all \fm at each
sound level and rate-responder behaviour in the lateral side bands.  The units
with \CF above \fc were more active and the peak response was at $\fm=450$ Hz,
100 Hz greater than the \ChTone model, predictably where \DS cells become more
active.  The on-\CF rate response was band-pass at 20 dB (\BMF at 100 Hz) and at
40 dB (\BMF at 150 Hz), however due to uncertainties in the rates at higher
sound levels, the rate \MTF profiles on-\CF were flat or low-pass. The temporal
\MTF response maps (Figures \ref{fig:Ch4:CTtwoMTF}B, D and F) had band-pass
characteristics for most active units and were strongest in the lateral side
bands.

The \BMF of the central unit was around 350 Hz for each of the stimulus levels
above 40 dB \SPL (
call_MTFmax_onCF(spl="40",cell="0",Ch="T1")[ :results replace raw ],
call_MTFmax_onCF(spl="60",cell="0",Ch="T1")[ :results replace raw ],
call_MTFmax_onCF(spl="80",cell="0",Ch="T1")[ :results replace raw ] for 40, 60
and 80 dB \SPL, respectively). The subtle variation in synaptic strength to the
\ChTtwo model increased the \BMF by 100 Hz relative to the \ChTone model. The
simplified band-pass \tMTF in Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:ANCNSummary} with an enhanced
resonant peak at \BMF had limited comparability with the band-pass \tMTF of the
\ChTtwo model. The transient chopper \tMTF response in Figure
\ref{fig:Ch4:RG94Chopper}E was more comparable with the \ChTtwo model with a
broader band-pass peak at high sound levels and higher cut-off frequencies.

# Qualitatively, the \tMTF response maps and on-CF responses in the TS cell models were very similar

* Discussion

The results in this chapter demonstrate the sucessful simulation of \AM coding over
the whole \CNSM model.
# In doing so, this work shows the success of the \CNSM model in reproducing
# responses to complex stimuli.
The primary physiological mechanisms for \AM detection and envelope encoding lie
in the inner ear or cochlea \citep{Viemeister:1979,ZwickerFastl:1999}. The
cochlea consists of the basilar membrane, the tectoral membrane-outer hair cell
mechanism, and the inner hair cell-\AN synapse. The signal processing mechanism
involves a filterbank of band-pass filters, an active-feedback filter, and a
half-wave rectifier followed by a low-pass filter. The
\citet{ZilanyCarney:2010} \AN model used in this chapter includes of all these
mechanisms and has been shown in this chapter to provide consistent and
phenomenologically accurate output in the \HSR and \LSR units. Irregularities
were only observed in responses to high \fm\space \AM tones at 80 dB \SPL.

The temporal responses of cells in the \CN depend on, and are limited by, the
capabilities of the \ANF input responses. Intra-nuclei synaptic interactions
within isofrequency microcircuits and across frequency channels, and the
intrinsic properties of each of the cell types, are best understood by observing
responses across the whole network. The next sections discuss the results
and their implications for each cell type simulated in this chapter.

# \citep{JorisLouageEtAl:2006,JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}.

** Golgi Cells

\glsunset{GABA}

The demonstration of the response of \GLG cells in the \CNSM model to \AM tones
in this chapter is limited by the absence of experimental data with which to
make a comparison.
# The novel \GLG cell neural model proposed that \GLG cells diminish timing
# information contained in their \ANF inputs due to the low pass filtering of its
# smoothing kernel. This approach derives from the hypothesis that \GLG cells are
# purely rate-level encoders and contribute to automatic gain mechanisms in the
# microcircuit \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998}.
The results in Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:fzerorate}C and Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:GMTF}
show that the spectro-temporal response of the \GLG cell model to \AM tones was
mainly dependent on the sound level and the spectral component of the stimulus.
The temporal component of \GLG cell output information was located toward the
edges of its response area and was diminished relative to its primary input,
\LSR fibres. Intrinsic mechanisms in the cell membrane play a significant role
in limiting temporal information. The envelope of synaptic input is drowned out
by the synaptic-dendritic smoothing function of the model. The low-pass filter
limits the post-synaptic neuron's ability to phase-lock to the modulating
frequency, especially at high \fm.


The functional influence of \GLG cells on the \CNSM model in response to
\AM tones is the automatic gain regulation of \DS and \TS cells. \GLG cells'
monotonic rate-level responses and their \GABAa inhibitory synapses control the
excitability in both stellate cells in a way that is linearly dependent on stimulus intensity.
At high \SPL, \HSR fibres are rate-saturated and their temporal \MTF response
diminishes with increasing sound level, producing background synaptic
noise in the microcircuit. \GLG cell inputs to \DS and \TS cells during \AM
tones aid in suppressing elevated, unsynchronised, continuous excitation and
enhance their synchronous response to modulated inputs.

# GABAergic \GLG cell synapses with
# \DS and \TS cells on their distal dendrites which shunts \ANF excitation on the
# dendrites without reaching the stellate cells' soma and its site of \AP activation.

# \GLG cells are low-firing monotonic rate-level units that, in the \CNSM model,
# have little temporal response to \AM tones.

** D Stellate Cells

\DS cells are critical to the \CNSM model's ability to encode temporal
information at high sound intensity levels. The cumulative results in this
chapter show the typical rate-responder behaviour in the \DS cell model's \rMTF
and enhanced, robust \tMTF responses (Figures \ref{fig:Ch4:DSMTF} and
\ref{fig:Ch4:DSonCF}). The enhanced synchronisation of the \DS cell model's
on-CF \tMTF changed from low-pass to band-pass with increase in sound level.
Consistently, \DS cell responses in adjacent frequency channels increase their
temporal information further from \fc up to the limit of their response area.

# Due to the wide spread of connections from \DS cells to \TS and \TV cells, the
# observation and recording of \DS cell responses across the network is im The
# envelope synchronisation in \DS units with a \CF above $\fc$ produced
# band-pass rate \MTFs.

# The temporal information at the channel with \CF $\fc$
# (Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:DSMTF}) was diminished by the strong GABAergic inhibition of
# Golgi cells; however, the majority of active \DS units showed strong
# synchronisation, which suggests synchronous tuning in \TV and \TS units
# throughout the \CN.


The functional role of \DS cells in the \CNSM model is to provide wide-band,
phasic inhibition to \TV and \TS cells. More specifically, they enhance the
entrainment of the \TS cells to complex stimulus envelopes through precisely
timed inhibition
\citep{JorisSmith:1998,RhodeGreenberg:1994,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990a,PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005,NeedhamPaolini:2006}.
\DS cells receive a large number of \HSR and \LSR units from a wide range of
frequency channels; consequently, the number of active inputs increases with intensity.
Correlated on-\CF\space \LSR units and \HSR inputs from upper and lower
side-bands with high \SI help to encode the stimulus envelope; however, dendritic
smoothing and uncorrelated on-\CF\space \HSR units are capable of diminishing
the entrainment of \DS cells to the envelope. The \DS cell model does not have
dendritic compartments or an equivalent smoothing filter as in other models
\citep{KalluriDelgutte:2003,WangSachs:1995}. This model does have a jitter (0.1
ms standard deviation) in the \ANF inputs to emulate the variable distance of
synapses for the site of activation at the axon hillock.

** Tuberculoventral Cells

The results of the \TV cell model show a general enhancement of temporal
information in response to \AM tones relative to \ANF inputs at low sound levels. The
strong enhancement is likely due to a combination of intrinsic mechanisms, afferent
excitation and inhibition by \DS units. The \fz response map of \TV cells in
Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:fzero}E showed high \SI values near boundaries of its
response area.
# \TV cells receive strong inhibition from \DS cells, but \DS cell
# input is inactive in this area.
Intrinsic mechanisms in the \TV cell model (Type I
classic \RM model) contribute to a high input resistance at the \RMP. The lower
leak potential (\Eleak) in the \TV cell model also increases the difference
between \RMP and \AP threshold. These mechanisms remove the DC component of
uncorrelated inputs and enhance the AC component of \HSR and \LSR excitatory
inputs.

At high sound levels, the strong inhibitory inputs from \DS cells create a
non-monotonic response in \TV cells. \TV cells' temporal response properties in
experimental studies have been shown to be complex and non-linear
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,JorisSmith:1998,Rhode:1999}. \TV cells are thought
to be responsible for delayed inhibition or echo-suppression
\citep{WickesbergOertel:1990} in \VCN units, but can also be involved in tuning
the temporal behaviour in \TS cells at low sound levels. In general, knowledge
of the role of \TV cells has been further expanded through the \CNSM model but
further investigation is required to explain inconsistencies in temporal
processing of \TV cells.

** T Stellate Cells

# The inhomogeneous population of \TS cells are classified into subgroups, namely
# sustained and transient choppers.
Intrinsic membrane properties and fast, synaptic
connections enable \TS units to be tuned to important temporal features of the acoustic
input \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}. The behaviour of \TS units is influenced
by all three interneurons in the stellate microcircuit. \AM rate responses of
on-\CF\space \TS cell models were fairly weak but temporal information was still
present.
In the \fz and \MTF analysis, the response of the \TS
cell subtypes showed insights into the complex spectro-temporal processing being
performed in the stellate microcircuit.

In the literature, robustness of temporal information to increased intensity or
in background noise was greatest in \ChT units compared to \ChS units
\citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994,Frisina:2001,JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990a,FrisinaWaltonEtAl:1993}.
The \fz (Figures \ref{fig:Ch4:fzero}, \ref{fig:Ch4:fzerorate}) and \MTF (Figures
\ref{fig:Ch4:CSMTF}, \ref{fig:Ch4:CToneMTF} and \ref{fig:Ch4:CTtwoMTF}) figures
show snapshots of the response characteristics in \TS cell models across all
cells in the network. In the \fz response analysis, the \ChS type \TS cell
models near the centre of the \AM response area had moderate rate and moderate
enhancement at high \SPL centred around \fc. The temporal response of the \ChTone
model was robust to increases in sound level. This unit did have high firing
rates and high \SI response near its response area edges, a V-shaped response
similar to the \HSR units. The \ChTtwo models's \fz response was less robust at
higher \SPL on-\CF but had similar V-shaped enhanced temporal output across
different \CFs.

Experimental data has shown \TS cells generally have low-pass \MTF at low sound
level and band-pass \MTF for higher sound levels for on-\CF\space \AM tones
\citep{FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990,RhodeGreenberg:1994}. The band-pass temporal
responses of different types of \TS cells aid in the transformation from a
low-pass, temporal encoding of \AM in ANFs to a more robust rate encoding in the
\IC based on preference for different \BMFs
\citep{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004,Frisina:2001}.  At 20 dB \SPL (only shown in
Figure \ref{fig:Ch4:ChopperONCFMTF}), the on-CF \tMTF responses were similar for
each subtype with high synchronisation at low SPL, a dip in \SI at 300 Hz and a
second peak above 0.8 \SI at 500 Hz. At higher sound levels, the \MTF response
characteristics of the chopper subtypes diverged. \ChS models had lower cut-off
frequencies than both the \ChT type models. The \ChTone model had primarily
low-pass \tMTF responses, but strong inhibition on-\CF and suppression of its
rate at higher \fm limit the conclusiveness of this model. The \ChTtwo had a
more consistent rate response and \tMTF responses that varied from band pass
on-\CF to strongly enhanced low-pass in its lateral sidebands.


Given the \TS cell subtypes' network parameters were optimised to chopping
characteristics for pure \CF tones, the results of the \CNSM model must be
viewed from that perspective. Current \TS cell models have investigated \AM
responses \citep{WiegrebeMeddis:2004,BahmerLangner:2006a} but their inaccurate
physiological design is not a good basis to fully understand temporal encoding
in the \CN stellate microcircuit. An exploration of the parameter space in the
\TS cells of the \CNSM model and their effects on the temporal characteristics
was not in the scope of this chapter but is an open prospect for future
research.

** Limitations of the CNSM Model in Modelling AM Encoding

#  - Transition from temporal to rate coding in auditory pathway

The limitations of the \CNSM model discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:ModelChapter}
are equally relevant to the study of \AM encoding presented in this chapter. The
performance of the \citet{ZilanyCarney:2010} AN model has been verified against
AM responses in cat ANFs \citep{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009,JorisYin:1992} and the
model remains the most phenomenologically-realistic in terms of AM encoding for
use in this study.


A further set of limitations are specifically relevant to \AM encoding as studied
in this chapter. Most importantly, synaptic delays in the \CNSM model are known
to play a role in modulating the delay of responses. The \CNSM model includes a
topographical delay from \ANFs to \CN neurons, as well as intrinsic connection
delays within the stellate microcircuit. Timing of inhibitory synaptic inputs
has a major role in regulating the latency of responses in \CN neurons,
particularly in \TS cells with the transient \IKA current
\citep{KanoldManis:2005,KanoldManis:2001}. Further work is required to investigate
 the effects of synaptic parameters in the \CNSM model in response to \AM
tones and stimuli, particularly with respect to highly synchronised \DS cell inhibition
of \TS cells.

# What can be done better in future work?

The major limitation of this chapter arises out of the fixed network parameter
set generated in Chapter \ref{sec:ModelChapter}. The output of \TS cells in this
chapter were routinely suppressed at high \SPL by strong inhibition from \DS
cells. Whether the design of the optimisation stimuli used in Chapter
\ref{sec:ModelChapter} fully encompassed the influence of \DS cells or the
phasic responses of \DS cells to \AM tones provides more effective inhibition is
still an open question. Also, the homogeneity of cell-type parameters and their
responses in the \CNSM model limit its realism and further work is required to
understand variability within cell types of the stellate microcircuit.


# is important for understanding off-CF
# responses simultaneously, however the lack of diversity in responses across the
# network limit the realism of the model.  [Homogeneity of synaptic delays,
# idealises ...]  [The output of \TS cells in this chapter were not ideal ...]
# # snapshot of parameters in the CN cells' input connections
# [homogeneous ANFs split into two SR groups - does this effect outcome in the CNSM

# [AM coding important for vocal communication in \fc less than 3kHz - why use 9
# kHz (suited the cat model)]

# As discussed in Chapter 3, the limitations of the AN model in terms of AM
# encoding, have a strong influence over the limitations of the CNSM model.

# Timing of inhibitory synaptic inputs have a major role of regulating responses in CN neurons
# \cite{KanoldManis:2005,KanoldManis:2001}. The presence of \IKA in \TS cells influences the
# phasic output

** Implications for Temporal Processing in BNN Models

Paradoxically, the complex temporal processing dynamics in a \BNN model with
excitatory and inhibitory connections can be both a benefit and a detriment to
the synchronised output of post-synaptic neurons. A mixture of modulated inputs
is beneficial when they are in phase with each other, but can be detrimental
when they are uniformly out of phase. Unsynchronised excitation (like that seen
in HSR fibres on-\CF in moderate to loud \AM tones) can saturate temporal
information and raise firing rates in the post-synaptic unit. Simultaneously, it
can be entrained to the envelope with fast, phasic, highly-synchronised
inhibition (like that seen in \DS cells) \citep{VreeswijkAbbottEtAl:1995}.
Unsychronised inhibition (like that seen in \GLG cells on-\CF) can be beneficial
to a saturated post-synaptic neuron by reducing the DC component of synaptic
inputs. Unsynchronised inhibition can also enhance the temporal output by
rectifying the AC component. Phase lags, irregularities in synaptic delays and
dendritic smoothing all contribute to reductions in temporal processing,
especially at the upper limits of \fm.

* Conclusion

By drawing on the \CNSM model's strong bio-physiological realism, this chapter
has demonstrated a viable approach for generating improved insight into \AM
encoding in the stellate microcircuit. The \CNSM model provides a more
realistic representation of \AM coding in the output of \GLG, \DS and \TV cells
than previous models. While the results of the three \TS cell analyses were
less convincing, they nonetheless provide a valid example of the diversity in
\AM encoding by chopper units.


\AM representation in lateral sidebands within the \CN is essential in
communicating valuable temporal information to higher auditory centres. The
whole-network approach used in this chapter provides a stronger basis for
understanding temporal coding of \AM than an approach based solely on \CF. This
chapter has demonstrated the need to model detailed neural microcircuits away
from basic receptive fields of individual units. The \CNSM model has been used
for detailed optimisation so that it can best illustrate the physiological
properties in \TS cells and the \CN stellate microcircuit. Further exploration
of the \CNSM model's parameters could cast further light on the role of
intrinsic cell properties and synaptic connectivity in the signal
transformations performed within the stellate microcircuit.
