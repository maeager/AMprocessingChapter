* Introduction

# The next chapter investigates the optimised \CNSM model with more the complex,
# biologically-realistic stimuli involved in amplitude modulation.


# This chapter investigates the output responses of neurons in the \CNSM model,

# # Chapter 3 has
# created optimised parameters based on simple stimuli (tones, noises, and
# clicks).
# This chapter tests the performance of the optimised \CNSM model
# to \AM sounds is
# critical

# To understanding how temporal information is processed and encoded in
# the auditory central nervous system, we need  .

\Gls{AM} is the periodic modulation of the sound amplitude of a carrier
frequency (see Figure \ref{fig:AM:def} \citep{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}). It is a
key feature of speech and other biologically relevant sounds
\citep{Bregman:1990}. Investigating \AM coding is a useful way of understanding
how temporal information is processed and encoded in the auditory system. The
\CN is a major processing stage between the \AN and higher auditory centres, so
modelling and numerical analysis of its processes are important for developing
the necessary insight.


This chapter presents the \AM coding behaviour of the \CNSM model. It focuses
specifically on the temporal behaviour in response to sinusoidal \AM stimuli.
The outputs of the \CNSM model are the \TS cells, which provide a robust
spectral representation of auditory information and enhanced coding of temporal
information, especially the pitch in complex environments
\citep{KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}.
# The \CNSM model contains three inhibitory interneurons, each controlling the
# rate and temporal response of \TS cells.
Despite rate saturation of \ANFs\space -- the input to the \CNSM model cells --
their ability to code temporal information is not disabled.
# The effects of intrinsic cell properties in the cells of the \CNSM model
The optimal coding of \AM is still provided across the network, more
specifically in lateral sidebands around the edges of the response area.


# The analysis study does not include \AM parameters modulation
# depth, and variationin \fc are not included in this study.
The analysis in this chapter investigates the responses of the \CNSM model to
variation in sound level and modulation frequency, \fm, using measures of
envelope synchronisation and average rate.  The analysis measures of \AM
encoding are introduced in the next section.
# Measures used to assess the neural output
# to \AM stimuli and the current knowledge of responses in the \AN and neurons of
# the \CNSM model to AM.

** Definition of Amplitude Modulation

\glsunset{fc}\glsunset{fm}
Figure \ref{fig:AM:def} shows the general properties of a sinusoidal \AM stumuls and the
response of an \AN model filterbank.  The general formula for an \AM
tone is
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}\label{eq:AMformula}
s(t) = [1 + m \sin(2\pi{}f_{\mathrm{m}}t)] \sin (2\pi{}f_{\mathrm{c}}t)
\end{equation}
\noindent
#+END_LaTeX
where /m/ is the modulation height /m/.  A portion of an \AM stimulus is shown
in Figure \ref{fig:AM:def}A, which is a 100\% modulated sinusoidal \AM tone
(/m/=1), with carrier frequency (\fc) 2 kHz and modulation frequency (\fm) of
100 Hz.  When transformed to the frequency-domain, the frequency components of
an \AM tone are a dominant spike at \fc and two components \fc $\pm$ \fm with
half the height of the component at \fc (Figure \ref{fig:AM:def}B).  The
\citet{ZilanyCarney:2010} \AN model was processed using an \AM tone (150 ms 65 dB
\SPL) with 100 frequency channels from 200 Hz to 40 kHz (centre frequencies
determined by the cat Greenwood function, see Section \ref{sec:Methods:ANFs})
and 20 \HSR fibres per frequency channel.  Figure \ref{fig:AM:def}C shows a
portion of the spike time histogram of 2000 \HSR \ANFs to a 150 ms \AM stimulus
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:AM:def}A.  A fast-fourier transform was applied to
the all-unit histogram (excluding the first 20 ms) and a spike time histogram of
the unit with \CF closest to \fc. The peaks in the all-unit fast-fourier
transform (arrows in Figure \ref{fig:AM:def}D) are the \fm (100 Hz) and its
harmonics.  The frequency components of \HSR fibres with \CF closest to \fc
(dotted line in Figure \ref{fig:AM:def}D) show synchronisation to \fc, typical
of low \CF \ANFs.

** Temporal Measures of Amplitude \protect{Modulation}

Temporal information in neural outputs is measured using the
\SI (also known synchronisation coefficient or vector strength)
\citep{GoldbergBrown:1969,ShannonZengEtAl:1995,MardiaJupp:1999,JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}.
\SI measures phase-locking relative to the \fm or envelope of the
stimuli. 
# In this analysis, the \SI values were combined for each modulation
# frequency to create the \tMTF.  
The \SI measure was calculated 20 ms after the
onset of the stimulus:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:SI}
  \mathsf{S} = \frac{1}{N} \sqrt{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} \cos \theta_i \right)^2 + \left(\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} \sin \theta_i \right)^2 }
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
\noindent where $N$ is the number of spikes
\citep{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004,KajikawaHackett:2005}.  Each spike was treated as
a vector of unit length with phase $\theta_i$ between 0 and $2\pi$ measured as
the spike time modulo of the stimulus period, $1/\fm$.  Perfect synchronisation
will give \SI equal to 1 and occurs when all spikes lock to the same phase. An
\SI measure of zero occurs when spikes have a uniform phase distribution.
Bi-phasic or multi-phasic responses (i.e.\space phase-locking to harmonics of
the fundamental) degrade the \SI value but the temporal information pertaining to
\fm is still retained for higher auditory centres.
Further measures of temporal information, i.e.\space phase-locking to any
frequency, is performed using a fast Fourier transform as in Figure \ref{fig:AMdef}.

# *** The Rayleigh Test

The statistical test used to verify the non-uniformity of circular data is the
Rayleigh test
\citep{ShannonZengEtAl:1995,Fisher:1996,Zar:1999,Jammalamadaka:2001}. The null
hypothesis states that the population of phases is uniformly distributed around
the circle. This test assumes the distribution is unimodal around a particular
phase.  \SI and the Rayleigh test are dependent on the number of spikes and the
resolution of the spike recordings (in simulations this is the integration time
step). For \SI values below 0.1, a high spike count is required to obtain a
statistically significant result.
# The Rayleigh test is equivalent to a Chi-squared test in uniform
# data. In neuroscience the Rayleigh test was originally calculated using
#  $2N(\mathsf{SI})^2$ \citep{Mardia:1972}.
# The critical p-values for this Rayleigh
# test were 5.991 for \alpha = 0.05 and 13.816 for \alpha = 0.001
# \citep{ShannonZengEtAl:1995,MardiaJupp:1999}.
The method for computing the p-value for the Rayleigh test is using the
approximation by \citet[p. 617]{Zar:1999}[fn::The code
was converted to use in NEURON from the CircStat Matlab
Toolbox \citep{Berens:2009}.]:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SIp}
p = \exp\left(\sqrt{1+4N+4(N^2-R^2)-(1+2N)}\right)
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
\noindent where $R=N\times\mathrm{S}$. \SI and Rayleigh tests were also calculated
using a fast Fourier transform of the period histogram to verify the procedure.

# (Further analysis of
# the critical values see W. Rhode's analysis on the vector
# strength and Rayleigh statistic[fn::  [[http://www.neurophys.wisc.edu/comp/docs/not011/not011.html]].] )

#  A more recent study looking at another \SI verification statistic has been
#  published (need to look into this).

** Amplitude Modulation Coding in the Auditory Pathway

The auditory pathway transforms a high-fidelity, metabolically intensive,
temporal-place encoding of \AM signals in the \AN into a more efficient
rate-place encoding in the \IC and higher auditory nervous system centres
\citep{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}.  Temporal coding of \AM relies on the precise
timing of spikes relative to the envelope of the stimulus, otherwise called
phase locking or synchrony.  Rate coding of \AM signals can take the form of
pure rate-place, rate-responder or feature-based encoding.  Pure rate-place is
where neurons encode the stumulus' energy spectrum in their receptive field
through simple firing rate changes.  Rate-responder encoding is where neurons
fire in each envelope cycle and as the cycle gets shorter the rate increases up
to a certain limit - this is common in low \CF units in the \AN and \CN, and
onset units (octopus cells) in the \PVCN.  Specialised feature-based rate coding
encodes particular features of AM signals, especially \fm, preference in \IC
neurons.


To investigate the response of CNSM model neurons to \AM tones, we tested 
variations in sound level and variations in modulation frequency, \fm.
The \fz response illustrates the encoding with respect to the stimulus sound
level, typically measured with a fixed \fm and a carrier frequency at a neuron's
\CF.
# effects of synchrony and rate to the stimulus  envelope (\fm) 
\Gls{MTF} is used in auditory neuroscience to measure the output of neurons in
response to variation in \fm.  The \rMTF measures the output in terms of firing
rate. Temporal encoding of modulation, \tMTF, is measured using \SI at each \fm.
Figure \ref{fig:AM:RG94MTF} shows the filter characteristics of low-pass and
band-pass tMTF responses \cite{RhodeGreenberg:1994}.  Low-pass filters
have a stable \SI response to low \fm stimuli that degrades when \fm increases
above the corner frequency.  Band-pass filters increase their synchrony to the \fm envelope
to a peak \SI response, called its \BMF, after which their synchrony deteriorates.

Temporal information is critical for vocal communication in the mammalian
auditory system.  In humans, \AM is essential for distinguishing vowels and for
segregation of streams of sounds with different fundamental frequencies
\citep{Bregman:1990}.  Firing rate is an efficient way of indicating a specific
quality or stimulus feature, as shown in other sensory pathways.  Rate coding in
the individual \ANFs and spectral coding across all \ANFs give a poor
representation of modulated signals
\citep{Frisina:1983,JorisYin:1992,JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}. The temporal coding
of \AM in auditory neurons is using fine timing of spikes locked to the stimulus
envelope.  Individual \ANFs can encode temporal information of \CF tones up
to 5 kHz and \AM tones up to 2 kHz.   

# This temporal information is measured using
# the synchronisation coefficient or \SI.


# When trying to understand the performance \AM responses in auditory units,
# different properties of \AM signals are varied.  Variation in sound level and
# \fm are common properties of \AM that are studied.

* Methods
** Stimulus

The stimulus generation followed Rhode and Greenberg's encoding of \AM in cats
\citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994}.  \AM signals were generated by modulating a carrier
signal of specified frequency, amplitude, and phase by a sinusoidal modulator
with amplitude and phase equal to that of the carrier (100\% modulation).
Modulation frequency, \fm, ranged from 50 to 1200 Hz and was stepped up by 50
Hz. The carrier frequency, \fc, was selected from each of the characteristic
frequencies of the exemplar \TS cell models (3.8, 8.91 or 12.3 kHz) in Chapter
\ref{sec:ModelChapter}.

** Simulations and Analysis

The simulations were performed using the neural simulation package [[latex:progname][NEURON]]
\citep{CarnevaleHines:2006}, as described in Chapter
\ref{sec:MethodsChapter}. [[latex:progname][NEURON]]'s Crank-Nicholson integration method was used
in the simulations with time step 0.05 ms, stimulus duration 150 ms and total
duration 170 ms. Stimuli were repeated 50 times and the spike times of all \ANF
and \CN units recorded.

To avoid onset adaptation effects in auditory neurons, simulations or recordings
prefer long stimuli so that the units' responses were in a steady-state.  Rate
analysis in each neuron was calculated from the average firing rate from 20 ms
after onset to the end of the stimulus. Temporal analysis used the same post
stimulus spikes in the calculation of \SI and the Rayleigh statistics.
# between 20 ms and the end of the stimulus.

** CNSM model

Table \ref{tab:AMModelSummary} shows the summary of the model used in this
study.  The Nordlie approach to reproducible neural network simulations
\citep{NordlieGewaltigEtAl:2009} is followed.  The parameters of the \CNSM model
were optimised in Section \ref{sec:ModelChapter} to fit the experimentally
observed behaviour of each of the cell types in the model.

* Results

** Responses to Changes in Stimulus Intensity

Sinusoidal \AM tones with fixed carrier and modulation frequencies (\fc = 8.9
kHz and \fm = 150 Hz) were presented to the \CNSM model to measure the \fz
response.  The \fz response illustrates the effects of synchrony to the stimulus
envelope (\fm) with respect to the stimulus sound level, typically measured with
the carrier frequency at a neuron's characteristic frequency. The stimulus
paradigm is similar to experimental methods; however, the \CNSM model allows the
inspection of a whole network of units with different \CFs.  The fixed modulation
frequency in this study, 150 Hz, is within the range of human speech fundamental
frequencies (women 150-300 Hz, men 75-150 Hz).  The carrier frequency is not in
the human speech range (most speech is between 200 - 3400 Hz with other relevant
information up to 8 kHz) but is in the human audibility range (64 Hz to 23 kHz)
\citep{Bregman:1990}.  This study uses the cat \AN model which has an audibility
range up-to 64 kHz \citep{SimmonsPopperEtAl:2002,FayPopper:1994}. The carrier
frequency of 8.9 kHz was chosen to avoid harmonics of \fm interfering with the
lateral side-bands of the stimulus and the range of \DS cell inputs.  The \AM
stimulus was presented to the AN and \CNSM model with duration of 150 ms and
repeated 50 times.  Spiking outputs 20 ms after the stimulus onset were used to
measure firing rate and \SI.

The colour bar shows the synchronisation index from 0 to 1, with white representing areas with Rayleigh test not statistically significant (p $>0.05$).

The \fz response maps for each cell in the \CNSM model are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:fzero}.  Each column represents a single unit's \fz response to the
AM stimulus, where, traversing on the y axis from bottom to top, the stimulus level varies
from 0 to 90 dB \SPL.  Each row in the \fz response maps represents the temporal
response (\SI) of units in adjacent frequency channels to a single presentation of the
stimulus to the \CNSM model at a fixed intensity.

Figures \ref{fig:fzero}A and B show the \fz response map of the \HSR and \LSR cell
types in the \CNSM model. \HSR\space \ANFs have a non-linear \fz response, with
\SI peaking around 0.6 at intensities 20-30 dB above threshold then reducing to
below 0.2 for intensities 60 dB above rate threshold \citep{JorisYin:1992}.
Loss of \fz response in \ANFs is typically due to saturation at the inner hair
cell to auditory nerve synapse or the encoding of higher harmonics rather than
the envelope.  The \citet{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009} AN model was designed to
replicate \AM responses and the \fz response.  The V-like \fz response map of
the \HSR fibres (Figure \ref{fig:fzero}A) shows the strong non-linear temporal
behaviour at each frequency channel surrounding the carrier frequency.
# at high
# intensities when the carrier frequency is centred on a unit's \CF.
For the unit on-CF (8.91 kHz), the peak \SI was 0.775 at 15 dB \SPL and then
subsequently fell below the Rayleigh test of statistical significance (p
$<0.05$) when the unit reached maximum firing rate at 40 dB \SPL.  Adjacent
network channels showed similar behaviour with an adjustment in rise and
fall of \SI based on excitation from the cochlea filter.  These results are
similar to the model results presented by \citet{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.  The
peak \SI in the map was 0.777 by unit 84 (CF 20.7 kHz) at 90 dB at approximately
50\% of maximum firing rate.

In \LSR\space \ANFs (Figure \ref{fig:fzero}B) the \fz response map maintains
moderate temporal information throughout the response area.  The \fz response of
the on-CF unit has its peak temporal response at rate threshold then slowly
reduces to a moderate temporal response at high intensity.  Across frequency
channels and intensities, active units near the edges of the response area
provide high ($>$ 0.8 \SI) temporal information.  At high intensities, units with
\CFs near the carrier frequency maintain moderate ($0.5 - 0.6$ \SI) temporal
information that is lacking in the \HSR units in this area.  The \fz response of
cells in the \CN are dependant on and are limited by the \ANF input responses.
Dependencies on intra-nuclei synaptic interactions within isofrequency
microcircuits and across frequency channels, and the intrinsic properties of
each of the cell types are best understood across responses from the whole
network.

\GLG cells receive a majority of their inputs from \LSR fibres that have high
temporal information throughput across the response area (Figure
\ref{fig:fzero}B). Figure \ref{fig:fzero}F shows the \GLG cells' \fz responses
are moderate to weak over the extent of the response area.  The diminished
temporal information is a result of the smoothing kernel in the \GLG neural
model.


Figure \ref{fig:fzero}D shows that the \DS cell \fz response map had a higher
rate threshold and enhanced the temporal information on-\CF at high intensities
relative to \HSR and \LSR units.  \Gls{OnC} units recorded from the dorsal
acoustic stria in cats have shown high \SI maintained above 0.8 up to 60 dB \SPL
then slopes down to 0.6 at 80 dB \SPL \citep{JorisSmith:1998}.  Maximum phase
response for the \DS cell model (results not shown) was linear over \SPL (similar
to experimental results).

The \fz response of \TV cells (Figure \ref{fig:fzero}E) shows an enhanced V-shape
map similar to \HSR units.  High \SI values (close to 1) near the rate threshold
boundary occur where \HSR units are at their peak in Figure \ref{fig:fzero}A.  \TV
cells receive strong inhibition from \DS cells, but \DS cells were inactive in
this area. This implicates intrinsic mechanisms in the \TV cell model and an
integration of \ANF inputs within the dynamic range that contribute to this
enhancement.
# contribute to a high input resistance at \RMP.  The lower leak potential
# (\Eleak) in the \TV cell model also increases the difference between \RMP and
# \AP threshold.  These mechanisms remove the DC component of uncorrelated inputs
# and enhances the AC component of \HSR and \LSR excitatory inputs.
In the centre of the \TV cell \fz response map (units with \CF near \fc at high
stimulus intensities), \SI values deteriorate to below 0.3. Here, \HSR inputs to
the \TV cell model are not temporally significant but the combination of \LSR
excitation and \DS cell inhibition with high temporal precision enhances the \TV
cells to encode temporally relevant information to cells in the microcircuit.


Figure \ref{fig:fzero}F shows the \fz response map of \TS cell models. \TS cells
receive inputs from all the other cell types in the \CNSM model.  The \TS cell
\fz response map has the same V-shape as the \HSR response map with elevated
temporal responses over the whole map (mean 0.70, min 0.366, max 0.973).  The
\fz response of the unit with \CF at \fc has a sharp rise in \SI at rate
threshold then falls to a stable level above 0.5 \SI at 50 dB \SPL, then to 0.4
\SI above 80 dB \SPL.  This behaviour reproduces the characteristic \TS cell \fz
response summarised in Figure \ref{fig:AM:ANCNSummary}.

** Responses to Changes in Modulation Frequency

The figures in this section show the rate and temporal response maps, across the entire
network, of \CNSM to an \AM tone with carrier frequency 8.91 kHz.  Modulation frequency
ranged from 50 to 1200 Hz in 50 Hz steps.  Each figure shows the mean firing
rate (\rMTF) on the left and the synchronisation index (\tMTF) on the right.
 The \SI values were masked in white if the Rayleigh coefficient was not statistically significant (p $< 0.05$).

Figure \ref{fig:AM:HSRMTF} shows the rate and temporal \MTF maps of \HSR\space
\ANFs to \AM tones with $\fc=8.91$ kHz.  \HSR fibres saturate to pure \CF tones
at 40 dB \SPL, whereas their response to \AM tones are dependent on the carrier
and modulating frequencies.  Figures \ref{fig:AM:HSRMTF}A, C and E show the
average rate response to \AM tones of varying \fm at stimulus intensities 80, 60
and 40 dB \SPL, respectively. The spread of excitation is consistent across \fm
at each intensity.  For \HSR units with \CF's above \fc, rate increases with \fm
and peaks around 600 Hz.  The rate peak occurs in unit 75 (CF 14 kHz) with rate
30\% greater than the unit closest to \fc (unit 65, \CF 8.9 kHz).

Temporal information in \HSR at each of the corresponding stimulus intensities
(Figures \ref{fig:AM:HSRMTF}B, D and F) is strongest near the edges of
excitation with a low-pass \tMTF extending beyond 1.2 kHz (the maximum range \fm
is this study).  At 80 dB \SPL (Figure \ref{fig:AM:HSRMTF}B), units with \CFs
15.26 kHz to 18.2 kHz had mean \SI of 0.75 with a peak 0.814.  Moving toward \fc,
the \HSR units lose low modulation frequency information to become band-pass
\tMTF filters until 11.7 kHz where the salient temporal information ceases.
Units between 11.7 kHz and 8.18 kHz (two frequency channels below the centre
unit) show a rapid deterioration of temporal information despite being at the
centre of the stimulus' energy.  Below the centre channel, band-pass \tMTF
responses increase in mean and peak values further away from the centre with the
apex at unit 54 (CF 5.43 kHz, mean \SI of 0.697, max \SI 0.785).

The \tMTF response observed at 60 dB \SPL (Figure \ref{fig:AM:HSRMTF}D) looks
similar to the 80 dB \SPL response with a reduced number of frequency channels
reflecting the reduced rate excitation range in Figure \ref{fig:AM:HSRMTF}C. The
dominant frequency channels below (unit 59, \CF 6.27 kHz, mean \SI 0.666 , max \SI
0.805) and above (unit 75, \CF 13.97 kHz, mean \SI 0.741, max \SI 0.787 ) are at
the border of rate threshold; showing a gradual increase of temporal information
in units further from the centre \CF unit. At 40 dB \SPL, the two salient
information bands begin to merge as the range of excited frequency channels get
closer to the centre \CF.

\Gls{LSR} fibers' rate responses to \AM tones was non-saturating and centred on the
carrier frequency (Figures \ref{fig:AM:LSRMTF}A, C and E). The \rMTF of the on-\CF
unit was typically low-pass but did fluctuate at modulation frequencies above
400 Hz for each stimulus intensity.

Figures \ref{fig:AM:LSRMTF}B, D and F show \LSR fibres in the AN model were
better at encoding temporal information than \HSR\space \ANFs. This has been
observed in cat \ANFs \citep{JorisYin:1992}.  The low-pass \tMTF is typical of
\ANFs and can be seen at each stimulus intensity, particularly in units above
the \fc. The \fm cut-off frequency for \LSR units was beyond the 1.2 kHz range
used in this study.  At 80 dB \SPL (Figure \ref{fig:AM:LSRMTF}B), \LSR units had
higher mean and peak \SI values than \HSR units (mean 0.74, max 0.937) above \fc
and the low-pass \tMTF response was maintained.  For the on-\CF unit (unit 65, \CF
8.91 kHz), its mean \SI 0.415 with a peak of 0.673 was the lowest of all salient
temporal response channels.  Below \fc, an unusual temporal response at high \fm
may relate to the rate fluctuations in Figure \ref{fig:AM:LSRMTF}A or a
reduction in the \fm cut-off frequency. The high gain, low-pass \tMTF responses
is observed at 60 and 40 dB \SPL stimulus intensities (Figures
\ref{fig:AM:LSRMTF}D and F).

# \yellownote{DG - should the above paragraph be in the discussion}

Figures \ref{fig:AM:RG94ANF}A and B shows the on-\CF rate and temporal \MTF
responses of a \HSR\space \ANF experimental data \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994}.  All
stimulus levels but the lowest (20 dB \SPL) showed saturated rate responses in
the on-CF \rMTF response of the \HSR\space \ANF (Figure \ref{fig:AM:RG94ANF}C).  The
sensitivity to \fm at 20 dB \SPL shows the typical rate-following characteristic
by phase-locking to each cycle and following the increase in the number of
cycles.  Temporal information was also more substantial at 20 dB for the \HSR
on-CF \tMTF response (Figure \ref{fig:AM:RG94ANF}D).  As shown in Figure
\ref{fig:AM:HSRMTF}, the on-CF \tMTF response becomes insignificant with
increasing sound level.  \LSR\space \ANF model's rate responses increased with sound
level but were insensitive to changes in \fm with flat \rMTF responses (Figure
\ref{fig:AM:RG94ANF}E).  The on-CF \tMTF responses of simulated \LSR \ANFs were
low-pass and linearly decreased with increasing sound levels but still
maintained moderate temporal information (Figure \ref{fig:AM:RG94ANF}F).  The
irregular errors in \HSR and \LSR\space \ANF responses at high \SPL and high \fm need to be
investigated further.

Figure \ref{fig:AM:G} shows the rate and temporal \MTF across the whole network
to \AM tone centred at 8.9 kHz. The \GLG cell models \rMTFs were typically
low-pass, mimicking the rate behaviour of \LSR fibres, its primary source of excitation.
The Golgi cell units had very low rates for 40 and 60 dB \SPL \AM tones, which
were limited to a narrow range around the central frequency.

The temporal \MTFs of Golgi units were significantly diminished relative to \LSR
fibres. The smoothing filter used in the \GLG cell model contributes to the
reduction of temporal information.  The peak temporal responses of the \GLG cell
model occurred at low \fm with a rapid drop off in \SI around 350 Hz.  The on-\CF
unit had a flat low-pass \tMTF before its Rayleigh test dropped below the
threshold. Its mean \SI from 50 to 1200 Hz (excluding values when the Rayleigh
test was below threshold) was 0.571, 0.376, 0.295, and 0.218 at stimulus
intensities 20, 40, 60, and 80 dB \SPL, respectively.  At the highest intensity,
80 dB \SPL in Figure \ref{fig:AM:G}B, units furthest from the carrier frequency
had greater temporal information (max \SI 0.715, unit 77 \CF 15.27 kHz); however,
with firing rates near threshold their effects on other neurons in the \CNSM
model are predominantly rate-based.

The broad \CF range of \ANF inputs to \DS units allows for a greater likelihood of
coincidence detection and an increase in synchronisation relative to the inputs.
The rate responses of \DS units (Figure \ref{fig:AM:DS}) were wider for 40 and
60 \SPL stimuli relative to the narrow band \TS units.  For 40 dB \SPL stimuli,
most \DS units had a band-pass \rMTF.  For higher \SPL, a greater number of
spikes occured between 100 and 500 Hz for units above \CF (band-pass \rMTF), but
the rest of the active units remained stable (low-pass \rMTF). This behaviour is
called "rate-responder" due to the linear increase in firing-rate being dictated to by shortening
of the \fm envelope period.  This is similar to ideal onset units in the \VCN
(octopus cells) but the cut-off of the \rMTF is much lower.
\yellownote{Need reference to rate-responder quote}

The temporal responses of \DS units were predominantly band-pass, with higher
\SI values than \ANFs.  For lower \SPL, the responses were consistent across
active units with a falling cut-off frequency with falling \CF.  For high \SPL,
the \DS units were divided along the central channel.  The \DS units above the
central channel had the strongest synchronisation and cut-off frequencies near
the upper limit of the \AN model.  The \DS units below the central channel had
cut-off frequencies around 400 Hz, similar to \TS and \TV units.

The rate and temporal responses of \TV units (Figure \ref{fig:AM:TV}) showed the
non-linear effects of strong inhibition from \DS units. \TS and \TV units
received similar \ANF inputs, but the inhibition limited the activity at low
sound level and then to a narrow range at higher \SPL.  The temporal responses
of \TV units were similar to \TS units but with lesser synchronisation and
sharper cut-off.  The outer edges of active units provided the best temporal
response with little to no temporal information at the carrier frequency units.

Figure \ref{fig:AM:TS} shows the final \MTF response of the \ChS \TS units in the
network.  The spread of excitation in \TS units was narrow around the central
channel, with greater excitation above \CF around fm=300 Hz. For higher sound
levels, the spread of excitation was wider but the rate was steadier for each
stimuli.  The significant features of the temporal responses in the right of the
figure are the very poor synchronisation in the central channel and dominant
synchronous responses at the outer edge of excitation.  For 40 dB \SPL, most
active units showed a band-pass \MTF; however, the dominant units above \CF
(channels 55 to 58) had low-pass \MTFs.  For 60 dB \SPL, most active units
showed band-pass \MTFs except for the central units, which showed limited
results or a low-pass \MTF.  Outermost active units (channels 65 to 60 and 45
to 40) had the most dominant temporal response across the \TS cell population.

* Discussion

The results in this chapter demonstrate the capacity to simulate \AM coding over
the whole \CN stellate network.
# In doing so, this work shows the success of the \CNSM model in reproducing
# responses to complex stimuli.

The primary mechanisms for \AM detection and envelope encoding lie in the inner
ear or cochlea \citep{Viemeister:1979,ZwickerFastl:1999}.  The cochlea consists
of the basilar membrane, the tectoral membrane-outer hair cell mechanism, and
the inner hair cell -- \AN synapse.  Respectably, the signal
processing consists of a filterbank of bandpass filters, an active-feedback
filter, a half-wave rectifier followed by a low-pass filter.  The
\citet{ZilanyCarney:2010} \AN model used in this chapter includes all these
mechanisms and has shown to provide consistent phenomenologically accurate
output in the \HSR and \LSR units.

# \citep{JorisLouageEtAl:2006,JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}.

** Golgi cells

\GLG cells' influence in the \CNSM model are through \GABA-ergic synapses with
\DS and \TS cells on their distal dendrites.  GABAergic distal inhibitory \PSPs
have not been shown in /in vitro/ studies \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a},
but application of bicuculline significantly increased the number of \APs in \DS
and \TS cells.  This slow shunting inhibition reduces the amount of \ANF
excitation reaching the stellate cells' soma and its site of \AP activation.  At
high \SPL, \HSR fibres are rate-saturated and their temporal \MTF response
diminishes with increasing sound level.

Golgi cells are low-firing monotonic rate-level units that, in the \CNSM model,
have little to no temporal response to \AM tones.  The results in Figure
\ref{fig:AM:G} show that response of the \GLG cell model to \AM tones is only
dependent on the sound level and that the temporal response is negligible.  The
high temporal information from individual \LSR\space \ANFs, the main excitatory
input of the \GLG cell model, would suggest Golgi cells would pass some of this
information on.  Convergence of fibres with different \CFs, hence different
delays, reduces the likelihood of coincident inputs. This mechanism is unlikely
to cause a severe reduction in temporal information, with the example being \DS
cells with a wider \CF convergence of \ANFs.  Intrinsic mechanisms in the cell
membrane play a significant role in limiting temporal information.  The envelope
of synaptic input is drowned out by the synaptic-dendritic smoothing function of
the model.  The low-pass filter limits the post-synaptic neuron's ability to
phase-lock to the modulating frequency, especially at high \fm.

** D stellate cells

\DS cells are critical to the \CNSM model's ability to encode temporal
information at high sound intensity levels.  More specifically, they enhance the
entrainment of the \TS cells to complex stimulus envelope through precisely timed
inhibition
\citep{JorisSmith:1998,RhodeGreenberg:1994,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990a,PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005,NeedhamPaolini:2006}.
The envelope synchronisation in \DS units with a \CF above $\fc$ produced
band-pass rate \MTFs.  The temporal information at the channel with \CF $\fc$
(Figure \ref{fig:AM:DS}) was diminished by the strong GABAergic inhibition of
Golgi cells; however, the majority of active \DS units showed strong
synchronisation, which suggests synchronous tuning in \TV and \TS units
throughout the \CN.

\DS cells receive a large number of \HSR and \LSR units from a wide range of
frequency channels; hence, the number of active inputs increases with intensity.
Correlated on-\CF \LSR units and \HSR inputs from upper and lower side-bands with
high \SI help to encode the stimulus envelope; however dendritic smoothing and
uncorrelated on-\CF \HSR units are capable of diminishing the entrainment of \DS
cells to the envelope. The \DS cell model does not have dendritic compartments
or equivalent smoothing filter as in other models
\citep{KalluriDelgutte:2003,WangSachs:1995}.  This model does have a jitter (0.1
ms standard deviation) in the \ANF inputs to emulate the variable distance of
synapses for the site of activation at the axon hillock.

# \citep{Frisina:2001,FrisinaWaltonEtAl:1993,FrisinaSmithEtAl:1990a}.

** Tuberculoventral cells

The results of the \TV cell model show a general enhancement of temporal
information to \AM tones relative to \ANF inputs.  The strong enhancement may be
due to a combination of intrinsic mechanisms, afferent excitation and inhibition
by \DS units.  The \fz response map of \TV cells in Figure \ref{fig:fzero}E showed
high \SI values near boundaries of its response area.  \TV cells receive strong
inhibition from \DS cell, but \DS cell input inactive in this area. Intrinsic
mechanisms in the \TV cell model (Type I classic \RM model) contribute to a high
input resistance at \RMP.  The lower leak potential (\Eleak) in the \TV cell
model also increases the difference between \RMP and \AP threshold.  These
mechanisms remove the DC component of uncorrelated inputs and enhances the AC
component of \HSR and \LSR excitatory inputs.

\yellownote{ The maximum firing
rate of the \TV cell model at high stimulus intensities (on-CF units, \AM tone,
80 dB \SPL, $>$ 400 spikes per second) is not consistent with the Type II \EIRA
behaviour of low firing rates in noise and high intensity.}


\TV cells' temporal response properties in experimental studies have been shown
to be complex and non-linear
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,JorisSmith:1998,Rhode:1999}.  In general, knowledge
of the role of \TV cells in temporal processing is incomplete.  \TV cells are
thought to be responsible for delayed inhibition or echo-suppression
\citep{WickesbergOertel:1990} in \VCN units, but can also be involved in tuning
the temporal behaviour in \TS cells at low sound levels.

** T stellate cells

The inhomogeneous population of \TS cells are classified into different
subgroups, namely sustained or transient choppers.  Intrinsic membrane
properties and synaptic connections enable \TS units to be enhanced or tuned to
important features of the acoustic input \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}. The
behaviour of \TS units is influenced by all three interneurons in the stellate
microcircuit.

\AM rate saturation of \TS units on \CF (Figure \ref{fig:AM:TS}) does not disable
their ability to encode temporal information.  Experimental data has shown \TS
cells generally have low-pass \MTF at low sound level and band-pass \MTF for
higher sound levels for \AM tones on \CF \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994}.  The
implications for the \AM coding in \TS output on higher-order auditory centres
have been investigated but not fully understood
\citep{WiegrebeMeddis:2004,BahmerLangner:2006a}.


 \yellownote{TODO -- the results are from optimised parameters that do not
 explicitly fit in our idea of a chopper neuron.  More work needs to be done on
 the TS cell model in Ch3 before this goes ahead.}

* Conclusion

The \CNSM model provides a more realistic model of \AM coding in the output of \TS cells.
# controlled and modulated enhancement of
# the output of \TS cells, one of the major outputs of the cochlear nucleus.
A whole-network approach may provide a stronger basis for optimal temporal
coding of \AM than an approach based solely on \CF.  This chapter has
demonstrated the need to model detailed neural microcircuits away from basic
receptive fields of individual units.  The model has been used for detailed
optimisation so that it can be used to investigate detailed physiological
properties in \TS cells and the \CN stellate microcircuit.

 - Transition from temporal to rate coding in auditory pathway
 - Stellate microcircuit provides controlled and enhanced output of \TS cells
 - \AM representation in lateral sidebands essential

 - Exploration of the \CN stellate microcircuit
 - Spectral/Rate representation in speech and speech in noise
   - lateral inhibition
   - neuromodulation
 - Temporal representation
   - enhancement of \SNR relative to individual \ANFs
   - period-tagging linked to multiple auditory streams

\citep{EvansZhao:1998,EvansZhao:1993a,BackoffShadduckEtAl:1999,CasparyBackoffEtAl:1994,PalombiCaspary:1992}
have been studied in the \CN with varying degrees of specificity. Further
simulations that vary intrinsic cell parameters or connection parameters in the
\CNSM model would provide a great insight into the primary mechanisms of its
temporal information processing.
