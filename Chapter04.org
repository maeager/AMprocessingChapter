* Introduction 

# The next chapter investigates the optimised \CNSM model with more the complex, biologically-realistic stimuli involved in amplitude modulation.


# This chapter investigates the output responses of neurons in the \CNSM model, 

# # Chapter 3 has
# created optimised parameters based on simple stimuli (tones, noises, and
# clicks).  
# This chapter tests the performance of the optimised \CNSM model


# to \AM sounds is
# critical 

# To understanding how temporal information is processed and encoded in
# the auditory central nervous system, we need  . 

\Gls{AM} is the periodic modulation of the sound amplitude of a carrier frequency
(see Figure \ref{fig:AM:def} \citep{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}). It is a key
feature of speech and other biologically relevant sounds. Investigating \AM
coding is a useful way of understanding how temporal information is processed
and encoded in the auditory nervous system. The \CN is a major processing stage
between the \AN and higher auditory centres, so modelling and numerical analysis
of its processes are important for developing the necessary insight.


Figure \ref{fig:AM:def} shows the response of an AN model filterbank 
 
The single Individual AN fibres can encode temporal information of simple tones up to 5 kHz. 

For reviews of neural encoding of sound-envelope information in the \AN and \CN see
\citet{FrisinaWaltonEtAl:1994,JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}.

This chapter presents the \AM coding behaviour of the \CNSM model. It focuses
specifically on the temporal behaviour in response to sinusoidal \AM stimuli.
The primary output of the \CNSM model are the \TS cells, which provide a robust
spectral representation of auditory information and enhanced coding of temporal
information, especially the pitch in complex environments
\citep{KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}.  The model contains three inhibitory
interneurons, each controlling the rate and temporal response of \TS cells.
Despite rate saturation of \ANFs -- the input to the \CNSM model cells -- their
ability to code temporal information is not disabled.
# The effects of intrinsic cell properties in the cells of the \CNSM model 
The optimal coding of \AM is
still provided across the network, more specifically in lateral sidebands around
the carrier frequency.

#     - poor \SNR in auditory nerve
  
The coding of \AM in auditory neurons is measured using a \MTF, which is
calculated using its discharge firing rate (\rMTF) or temporal information
(\tMTF). The degree of phase locking is measured by the \SI (also called vector strength) 
\citep{GoldbergBrownell:1973,GoldbergBrown:1969,JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}.  \SI
is a dimensionless measure of phase locking for a particular frequency, where
the magnitude of synchronisation at that frequency is divided by the baseline
synchronisation (which is also the average firing rate) \citep{Johnson:1980}.

# \begin{equation} \label{eq:SI} 
# SI = \frac{1}{N} \sqrt{\left(\sum_{i}^{N} x_i \right)^{2} + \left( \sum_{i}^{N} y_i \right)^{2}}

# the number of spike times.  Each spike is treated as a vector of unit length and
# with phase $\theta_{i}$ between 0 and $2\pi$ measured as the spike time modulo
# of the stimulus period, $1/f_{m}$.  Perfect synchronisation will give SI = 1,
# whereas values below 0.1 are considered insignificant.  The SI values are
# combined for each modulation frequency to create the \tMTF.  Statistical
# significance of synchronization is usually quantified with the Rayleigh test
# \citep{BuunenRhode:1978,MardiaJupp:1999}. Vector strength and Rayleigh
# coefficient, calculated to verify the statistical significance of
# synchronisation, can also be obtained from the Fourier spectrum of the \PSTH or
# period histogram.
# , in which case it equals the magnitude of the first harmonic, normalised by
# the DC component (average firing rate).  Phase can also be retrieved with
# either technique.  The rate measure (\rMTF) is calculated from the mean firing
# rate in the \PSTH, between 20 ms and the end of the stimulus.

* Methods

** Stimulus

The stimulus generation followed Rhode and Greenberg's encoding of amplitude
modulation in cats \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994}.  \AM signals were generated by
modulating a carrier signal of specified frequency, amplitude, and phase by a
sinusoidal modulator with amplitude and phase equal to that of the carrier
(100\% modulation).  Modulation frequency, f_m, ranged from 50 to 800 Hz and was
stepped up by 50 Hz. The carrier frequency was set to the central frequency
channel of the \CN model (5.82 kHz) or to the characteristic frequency of the
different \TS chopper models.

** Simulations

The simulations were performed using the neural simulation package [[latex:progname][NEURON]]
\citep{CarnevaleHines:2006}, as described in Chapter
\ref{sec:MethodsChapter}. [[latex:progname][NEURON]]'s Crank-Nicholson integration method was used
in the simulations with time step, /dt/ = 0.05 ms, stimulus duration 150 ms and
total duration 170 ms. Stimuli were repeated 50 times and the spike times of all
\ANF and \CN units recorded.

# \yellownote{What are you doing here}

** Rate and Temporal Analysis in Amplitude Modulation

The rate measure (\rMTF) was calculated from the mean firing rate in the neuron,
between 20 ms and the end of the stimulus. In the AN,  the firing rate saturates
\yellownote{TODO rate analysis}


The temporal measure used to analyse the spike output of an individual neuron
for one \AM stimulus is called the \SI (also called the vector strength)
\citep{GoldbergBrown:1969,ShannonZengEtAl:1995,MardiaJupp:1999,JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}.
\SI measures temporal information, i.e.\space phase-locking, relative to the
modulation frequency of the stimuli. The \SI values are combined for each
modulation frequency to create the \tMTF.  The SI measure was calculated 20 ms
after the onset of the stimulus, using Equation \ref{eq:SI}:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:SI} 
  \mathsf{SI} = \frac{1}{N} \cdot \sqrt{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} x_i \right)^2 + \left(\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} y_i \right)^2 }
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
\noindent where $x_i = \cos \theta_i$, $y_i = \sin \theta_i$, and $N$ is the number of spikes
\citep{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004,KajikawaHackett:2005}.  Each spike is treated as
a vector of unit length and with phase $\theta_i$ between 0 and $2\pi$ measured as the
spike time modulo of the stimulus period, $1/f_m$.  Perfect synchronisation will
give \SI = 1 occurs when all spikes lock to the same phase. An SI measure of
zero occurs when spikes have a uniform probability phase distribution.
Bi-phasic or multi-phasic responses (i.e.\space phase-locking to harmonics of
the fundamental) degrade the SI value but the temporal information pertaining to
f_0 is still retained for higher auditory centres. Further measures of temporal
information, i.e.\space phase-locking to any frequency, is performed using a
fast Fourier transform.

# *** The Rayleigh Test

The statistical test used to verify the non-uniformity of circular data is the
Rayleigh test. The Rayleigh test is equivalent to a Chi-squared test in uniform
data. In neuroscience the Rayleigh test was originally calculated using $2 N
(\mathsf{SI})^2$ \citep{Mardia:1972}.  The critical p-values for this Rayleigh
test were 5.991 for \alpha = 0.05 and 13.816 for \alpha = 0.001
\citep{ShannonZengEtAl:1995,MardiaJupp:1999}.  The preferred method for
computing the p-value for the Rayleigh test is using a z-statistic
\citep{Zar:1999}:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:SIz}
 z = R^2 / N
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
\noindent where is $R = N\times\mathsf{SI}$. The p-values were calculated using the
approximation in \citet[p. 617]{Zar:1999}:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SIp}
p = \exp\left(\sqrt{1+4N+4(N^2-R^2)}-(1+2N)\right).
\end{equation} 
#+END_LaTeX
For \SI values below 0.1, a high spike count is required to obtain a
statistically significant result.  \SI and Rayleigh tests were also calculated
using a fast Fourier transform of the period histogram to verify the procedure.

# (Further analysis of
# the critical values see W. Rhode's analysis on the vector
# strength and Rayleigh statistic[fn::  [[http://www.neurophys.wisc.edu/comp/docs/not011/not011.html]].] )

#  A more recent study looking at another \SI verification statistic has been
#  published (need to look into this).

* Results of Amplitude Modulation 

** Responses to Changes in Stimulus Intensity

Sinusoidal \AM tones with fixed carrier and modulation frequencies (\fc = 8.9 kHz
and \fm = 150 Hz) were presented to the \CNSM model to measure the f_0 response.
The f_0 response illustrates the effects of synchrony with respect to the
stimulus sound level, typically measured at a neuron's CF. The stimulus paradigm
is similar to experimental methods, however the \CNSM model allows the
inspection of a whole network of units with different CF's.  The AM stimulus was
presented to the AN and \CNSM model, with duration of 150 ms and repeated 50
times.  Spiking outputs 20 ms after the stimulus onset were used to measure
firing rate and \SI.

\HSR \ANFs have a non-linear f_0 response, with \SI peaking around 0.6 at
intensities 20-30 dB above threshold then reducing to below 0.2 for intensities
60 dB above rate threshold \citep{JorisYin:1992}.  The
\citet{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009} AN model was designed to replicate \AM responses
and the f_0 response.  Figures \ref{fig:fzero}A and B show the f_0 response map of
the HSR and LSR cell types in the \CNSM model. The V-like f_0 response map of the
\HSR fibres (Figure \ref{fig:fzero}A) shows the strong non-linear temporal
behaviour at each frequency channel surrounding the carrier frequency.
# at high
# intensities when the carrier frequency is centred on a unit's CF.  
For the unit on CF (8.91 kHz), the peak SI was 0.775 at 15 dB SPL then fell
below 0.1 and then below the Rayleigh test's for statistical significance (p $ <
0.05$) when the unit reached maximum firing rate at 40 dB SPL.  Adjacent network
channels followed a similar behaviour with an adjustment in rise and fall of SI
based on its excitation from the cochlea filter.  These results are similar to
the model results presented in \citet{ZilanyBruceEtAl:2009}.  The peak SI in the
map was 0.777 by unit 84 (CF 20.7 kHz) at 90 dB at approximately 50\% of maximum
firing rate.

In \LSR \ANFs, Figure \ref{fig:fzero}B, the f_0 response slides from its peak
temporal response at excitation threshold to a moderate temporal response at
high intensity.  Across frequency channels at high intensity, all active units
provide high ($>$ 0.8 SI) to moderate ($0.5--0.6$ SI) temporal information that
is lacking in the HSR units.
   

The f_0 response of cells in the \CN reflect the ANF input responses, the
intra-nuclei synaptic interactions within and across frequency channels, and the
intrinsic properties of each of the cell types.  \GLG cells
(Figure\ref{fig:fzero}F) receive a majority of their inputs from \LSR fibres,
however the high temporal information is diminished by the smoothing kernel in
the neural model. \DS cells receive a large number of HSR and LSR units from a
wide range of frequency channels. Figure\ref{fig:fzero}D shows the DS cell f_0
response map had a higher rate threshold and enhanced the temporal information
on-CF at high intensities relative to HSR and LSR units.

\yellownote{TV cells have extremely high SI near rate threshold boundary.  TV
cells receive strong inhibition from DS cell, but DS cell input inactive in this
area. Intrinsic mechanisms (Type-I RM model) with a high input resistance
removes the DC component and enhances the AC component of HSR excitatory
inputs. }

\yellownote{TS cells receive inputs from all cell-types in the CNSM model.  The
TS cell f0 response map has the same shape as the LSR response map with
elevated temporal responses over the whole map (Mean 0.704722, Min 0.366536, Max
0.973461).  }

** Responses to Changes in Modulation Frequency
# ** ISSNIP results

#  - Note the responses in the ISSNIP data was simulated with the early Bruce
#    model and the \TS parameters were just the default values (equivalent to the
#    \ChS model)

The figures below show the rate and temporal responses, across the entire
network, to an \AM tone with carrier frequency 8.91 kHz .  Modulation frequency
ranged from 50 to 1200 Hz in 50 Hz steps.  Each figure shows the mean firing
rate (rMTF) on the left and the synchronisation index (tMTF) on the right.  The
SI values were masked in white if the Rayleigh coefficient were not above 13.681
(\alpha < 0.001).

# The sound level of each stimulus
# was set to 40 dB \SPL for the top row and 60 dB \SPL for the bottom row.


*** ANF Model Results

Figure \ref{fig:AM:HSRMTF} shows the rate and temporal \MTF maps of \HSR \ANFs
to \AM tones with $\fc=8.91$ kHz.  \HSR fibres saturate to pure \CF tones at 40
dB SPL, whereas their response to AM tones are dependent on the carrier and
modulating frequencies.  Figures \ref{fig:AM:HSRMTF}A, C and E show the average
rate response to AM tones of varying \fm at stimulus intensities 80, 60 and 40 dB
SPL, respectively. The spread of excitation is consistent across \fm at each
intensity.  For HSR units with CF's above \fc, rate increases with \fm and peaks
around 600 Hz.  The rate peak occurs in unit 75 (CF 14 kHz) with rate 30\%
greater than the unit closest to \fc (unit 65, CF 8.9 kHz).

Temporal information in \HSR at each of the corresponding stimulus intensities
(Figures \ref{fig:AM:HSRMTF}B, D and F) is strongest near the edges of
excitation with a low-pass \tMTF extending beyond 1.2 kHz (the maximum range \fm
is this study).  At 80 dB SPL (Figure \ref{fig:AM:HSRMTF}B) units with CFs 15.26
kHz to 18.2 kHz had mean SI of 0.75 with a peak 0.814.  Moving toward \fc the
\HSR units lose low modulation frequency information to become band-pass \tMTF
filters until 11.7 kHz where the salient temporal information ceases.  Units
between 11.7 kHz and 8.18 kHz (two frequency channels below the centre unit)
show a rapid deterioration of temporal information despite being at the centre
of the stimulus' energy.  Below the centre channel, band-pass \tMTF responses
increase in mean and peak values further away from the centre with the apex at
unit 54 (CF 5.43 kHz, mean SI of 0.697, max SI 0.785).

The \tMTF response observed at 60 dB SPL (Figure \ref{fig:AM:HSRMTF}D) looks
similar to the 80 db SPL response with a reduced number of frequency channels
reflecting the reduced rate excitation range in Figure \ref{fig:AM:HSRMTF}C. The
dominant frequency channels below (unit 59, CF 6.27 kHz, mean SI 0.666 , max SI
0.805) and above (unit 75, CF 13.97 kHz, mean SI 0.741, max SI 0.787 ) are at
the border of rate threshold; showing a gradual increase of temporal information
in units further from the centre CF unit. At 40 dB SPL, the two salient
information bands begin to merge as the range of excited frequency channels get
closer to the centre CF.

\Gls{LSR} fibers' rate responses to AM tones was non-saturating and centred on the
carrier frequency (Figures \ref{fig:AM:LSRMTF}A, C and E). The \rMTF of the on-CF
unit was typically low-pass but did fluctuate at modulation frequencies above
400 Hz for each stimulus intensity.

Figures \ref{fig:AM:LSRMTF}B, D and F show LSR fibres in the AN model were
better at encoding temporal information than \HSR \ANFs. This has been observed
in cat ANFs \citep{JorisYin:1992}.  The low-pass \tMTF is typical of \ANFs and
can be seen at each stimulus intensity, particularly in units above the \fc. The
f_m cut-off frequency for LSR units was beyond the 1.2 kHz range used in this
study.  At 80 dB SPL (Figure \ref{fig:AM:LSRMTF}B), \LSR units had higher mean
and peak SI values than HSR units (mean 0.74, max 0.937) above \fc and the
low-pass \tMTF response was maintained.  For the on-CF unit (unit 65, CF 8.91
kHz), its mean SI 0.415 with a peak of 0.673 was the lowest of all salient
temporal response channels.  Below \fc, an unusual temporal response at high f_m
may relate to the rate fluctuations in Figure \ref{fig:AM:LSRMTF}A or a
reduction in the f_m cut-off frequency. The high gain, low-pass \tMTF responses
is observed at 60 and 40 dB SPL stimulus intensities (Figures
\ref{fig:AM:LSRMTF}D and F).

Figure \ref{fig:AM:G} shows the rate and temporal \MTF across the whole network
to AM tone centred at 8.9 kHz. The GLG cell model's r\MTFs were typically
low-pass mimicking the rate behaviour of \LSR, its primary source of excitation.
The Golgi cell units had very low rates for 40 and 60 dB \SPL \AM tones which
were limited to a narrow range around the central frequency.

The temporal \MTFs of Golgi units was significantly diminished relative to \LSR
fibres. The Golgi smoothing filter used in the GLG cell model contributes to the
reduction of temporal information.  The peak temporal responses of the GLG cell
model occurred at low f_m with a rapid drop off in SI around 350 Hz.  The on-CF
unit had a flat low-pass tMTF before its Rayleigh test dropped below the
threshold. Its mean SI from 50 to 1200 Hz (excluding values when the Rayleigh
test was below threshold) was 0.571, 0.376, 0.295, 0.218 at stimulus
intensities 20, 40, 60, and 80 dB SPL, respectively.  At the highest intensity,
80 dB \SPL in Figure \ref{fig:AM:G}B, units furthest from the carrier frequency
had greater temporal information (max SI 0.715, unit 77 CF 15.27 kHz), however
with firing rates near threshold their effects on other neurons in the \CNSM
model are predominantly rate-based.

The broad \CF range of \ANF inputs to \DS units allows for a greater likelihood of
coincidence detection and an increase in synchronisation relative to the inputs.
The rate responses of \DS units (Figure \ref{fig:AM:DS}) were wider for 40 and
60 \SPL stimuli relative to the narrow band \TS units.  For 40 dB \SPL stimuli,
most \DS units had a band-pass \rMTF.  For higher \SPL, a greater number of
spikes occured between 100 and 500 Hz for units above \CF (band-pass \rMTF), but
the rest of the active units remained stable (low-pass \rMTF). This behaviour is
called ``rate-responder'' due to the firing-rate being dictated to by shortening
of the $f_m$ envelope period.  This is similar to ideal onset units in the \VCN
(octopus cells) but the cut-off of the \rMTF is much lower.


The temporal responses of \DS units were predominantly band-pass, with higher
\SI values than \ANFs.  For lower \SPL, the responses were consistent across
active units with a falling cut-off frequency with falling \CF.  For high \SPL,
the \DS units were divided along the central channel.  The \DS units above the
central channel had the strongest synchronisation and cut-off frequencies near
the upper limit of the \AN model.  The \DS units below the central channel had
cut-off frequencies around 400 Hz, similar to \TS and \TV units.

The rate and temporal responses of \TV units (Figure \ref{fig:AM:TV}) showed the
non-linear effects of strong inhibition from \DS units. \TS and \TV units
received similar \ANF inputs, but the inhibition limited the activity at low
sound level and then to a narrow range at higher \SPL.  The temporal responses
of \TV units were similar to \TS units but with lesser synchronisation and
sharper cut-off.  The outer edges of active units provided the best temporal
response with little to no temporal information at the carrier frequency units.

Figure \ref{fig:AM:TS} shows the final \MTF response of the \ChS \TS units in the
network.  The spread of excitation in \TS units was narrow around the central
channel, with greater excitation above \CF around fm=300 Hz. For higher sound
levels, the spread of excitation was wider but the rate was steadier for each
stimuli.  The significant features of the temporal responses in the right of the
figure are the very poor synchronisation in the central channel and dominant
synchronous responses at the outer edge of excitation.  For 40 dB \SPL, most
active units showed a band-pass \MTF; however, the dominant units above \CF
(channels 55 to 58) had low-pass \MTFs.  For 60 dB \SPL, most active units
showed band-pass \MTFs except for the central units, which showed limited
results or a low-pass \MTF.  Outermost active units (channels 65 to 60 and 45
to 40) had the most dominant temporal response across the \TS cell population.

* Discussion

The results in this chapter demonstrate the capacity to simulate \AM coding over the whole \CN
stellate network.  In doing so, this work shows the success of the
\CNSM model in reproducing responses to complex stimuli.


** GLG cells

\GLG cells' influence in the \CNSM model is through \GABA-ergic synapses with
\DS and \TS cells on their distal dendrites.  GABAergic distal inhibitory \PSPs
have not been shown in /in vitro/ studies \citep{FerragamoGoldingEtAl:1998a},
but application of bicuculline significantly increased the number of \APs in \DS
and \TS cells.  This slow shunting inhibition reduces the amount of \ANF
excitation reaching the stellate cells' soma and its site of \AP activation.  At
high \SPL, \HSR fibres are rate-saturated and their temporal \MTF response
diminishes with increasing sound level.

Golgi cells are low-firing monotonic rate-level units that, in the \CNSM model,
have little to no temporal response to AM tones.  The results in Figure
\ref{fig:AM:G} show that response of the \GLG cell model to \AM tones is only
dependent on the sound level and that the temporal response is negligible.  The
high temporal information from individual \LSR \ANFs, the main excitatory input
of the \GLG cell model, would suggest Golgi cells would pass some of this
information on.  Convergence of fibres with different \CFs, hence different
delays, reduces the likelihood of coincident inputs. This mechanism is unlikely
to cause a severe reduction in temporal information, with the example being \DS
cells with a wider \CF convergence of \ANFs.  Intrinsic mechanisms in the cell
membrane play a significant role in limiting temporal information.  The envelope
of synaptic input is drowned out by the synaptic-dendritic smoothing function of
the model.  The low-pass filter limits the post-synaptic neuron's ability to
phase-lock to the modulating frequency, especially at high f_m.



** DS cells


D stellate cells have an onset chopping behaviour to tones, but can follow the
repetition of amplitude modulated tones. The entrainment to the stimulus
envelope produced band-pass rate \MTFs in \DS units with a \CF above $\fc$.  The
temporal information at the channel with \CF=$\fc$ (Figure \ref{fig:AM:DS}) was
diminished by the strong GABAergic inhibition of Golgi cells; however, the
majority of active \DS units showed strong synchronisation, which suggests
synchronous tuning in \TV and \TS units throughout the \CN.


\yellownote{TODO:  (Joris and Smith 1998) OC cells recorded from the DAS along with
type II, II and IV units in DCN, DAS of cats AM RL < tone RL < noise RL.  AM
SI-Level maintains above 0.8 up to 60dB then slopes down to 0.6 at 80 dB, phase
is linear over SPL.  AM experiments are recorded using long AM stimuli, rate
responses should be match to long tone responses as well (more significant for
type IV).  Median max SI = 0.93 (n=12), 3dB cutoff CFs>10kHz comparable to ANFs
~1000Hz.  }

 
** TV cells

The rate and temporal response of \TV cells was strongly inhibited by \DS units.
TV cells are thought to be responsible for delayed inhibition or
echo-suppression \citep{WickesbergOertel:1990} in \VCN units, but can also be
involved in tuning the temporal behaviour in \TS cells at low sound levels.
In general, knowledge of the role of \TV cells in temporal processing is
incomplete.  \TV cells' temporal response properties are complex and non-linear
\citep{SpirouDavisEtAl:1999,JorisSmith:1998}.

\yellownote{The current result show the TV cells with enhanced temporal encoding
across CFs and across intensities relative to ANFs.  NOTE-- these results don't seem right }



** TS cells

The inhomogeneous population of \TS cells are classified into different
subgroups, namely sustained or transient choppers.  Intrinsic membrane
properties and synaptic connections enable \TS units to be enhanced or tuned to
important features of the acoustic input \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}. The
behaviour of \TS units is influenced by all three interneurons in the stellate
microcircuit.

\AM rate saturation of \TS units on \CF (Figure \ref{fig:AM:TS}) does not disable
their ability to encode temporal information.  Experimental data has shown \TS
cells generally have low-pass \MTF at low sound level and band-pass \MTF for
higher sound levels for \AM tones on \CF \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994}.  The
implications for the \AM coding in \TS output on higher-order auditory centres
have been investigated but not fully understood
\citep{WiegrebeMeddis:2004,BahmerLangner:2006a}. 


 \yellownote{TODO -- the results are from optimised parameters that do not
 explicitly fit in our idea of a chopper neuron.  More work needs to be done on
 the TS cell model in Ch3 before this goes ahead.}


* Conclusion

The \CNSM model provides a more realistic model of \AM coding in the output of \TS cells.  
# controlled and modulated enhancement of
# the output of \TS cells, one of the major outputs of the cochlear nucleus.  
A whole-network approach may provide a stronger basis for optimal temporal
coding of \AM than an approach based solely on \CF.  This chapter has
demonstrated the need to model detailed neural microcircuits away from basic
receptive fields of individual units.  The model has been used for detailed
optimisation \citep{EagerGraydenEtAl:2006,EagerGraydenEtAl:2007a} so that it can
be used to investigate detailed physiological properties in the \CN stellate
network.
