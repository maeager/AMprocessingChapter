* Introduction 

This chapter presents the amplitude modulated coding behaviour in a
biophysically-realistic neural network model, the \CNSM model. It focuses
specifically on the temporal behaviour in response to sinusoidal amplitude
modulated (AM) stimulus.  The primary output of the \CNSM model are the \TS
cells, which provide a robust spectral representation of auditory information,
and enhanced coding of temporal information especially the pitch in complex
environments \citep{KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}.  The model contains three
inhibitory interneurons, each controlling the rate and temporal response of \TS
cells.  Despite rate saturation of \ANFs, the input to the \CNSM model cells,
their ability to code temporal information is not disabled. The effects of
intrinsic cell properties in the cells of the \CNSM model
 The optimal coding of
amplitude modulation is still provided across the network, more specifically in
lateral sidebands around the carrier frequency.


Here we simulate the \AM coding behaviour in a biophysically-realistic neural
network model of the \CN stellate microcircuit (previously discussed in Chapter
3).  \TS cells are the major output of the \CN and provide a robust spectral
representation of auditory information.  \TS cells also show enhanced coding of
temporal information, particularly in the synchronisation to modulation in
speech sounds \citep{BlackburnSachs:1990,KeilsonRichardsEtAl:1997}.  The coding
of \AM in neurons is measured using a \MTF, which is calculated using its firing
rate (\rMTF) or temporal information (\tMTF).

** Temporal Coding in the Auditory Pathway

- Need to expand on why temporal coding is essential
 - voice communication in mammals, birds, frogs etc.
 - summary of work \citep{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}
 - eg. Spectral/Rate Coding poor representation of modulated signals
    - mean rate of spikes
    - saturation at high sound level
    - poor \SNR in auditory nerve
  
The coding of \AM in neurons is measured using a \MTF, which is calculated using
its firing rate (\rMTF) or temporal information (\tMTF). The degree of phase
locking is measured by the \SI or vector strength
\citep{GoldbergBrownell:1973,GoldbergBrown:1969,JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}.

# the number of spike times.  Each spike is treated as a vector of unit length and

# of the stimulus period, $1/f_{m}$.  Perfect synchronisation will give SI = 1,
# whereas values below 0.1 are considered insignificant.  The SI values are
# combined for each modulation frequency to create the \tMTF.  Statistical
# significance of synchronization is usually quantified with the Rayleigh test
# \cite{BuunenRhode:1978,MardiaJupp:1999}. Vector strength and Rayleigh
# coefficient, calculated to verify the statistical significance of
# synchronisation, can also be obtained from the Fourier spectrum of the \PSTH or
# period histogram.
#, in which case it equals the magnitude of the first harmonic, normalised by
# the DC component (average firing rate).  Phase can also be retrieved with
# either technique.  The rate measure (\rMTF) is calculated from the mean firing
# rate in the \PSTH, between 20 ms and the end of the stimulus.

** Existing CN Models' response to AM  

  - Inadequate existing \CN models
  - Zilany \AN model
    - accurate synchronisation behaviour
  - Existing models not realistic
    - Wiegrebe \& Meddis: Point neurons, strong recurrent connections, operate
outside physiological range
    - Bahmer \& Lagner: Point neurons, hypothetical network
    - New \AN model synchronisation behaviour more accurate







* Methods

** Stimulus

Stimulus generation follows Rhode and Greenberg's \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994}
encoding of amplitude modulation in cats.  \AM signals were generated by
modulating a carrier signal of specified frequency, amplitude, and phase by a
sinusoidal modulator whose amplitude and phase were equal to that of the carrier
(100\% modulation).  Modulation frequency, f_m, ranged from 50 to 800 Hz and was
stepped up by 50 Hz. The carrier frequency was set to the central frequency
channel of the \CN model (5.82 kHz) or to the characteristic frequency of the
different \TS chopper models.

** Simulations

The simulations were performed using the neural simulation package [[latex:progname][NEURON]]
\citep{CarnevaleHines:2006}, as described in Chapter \ref{chp:Methods}. [[latex:progname][NEURON]]'s Crank-Nicholson integration method was used in the simulations with time step,
/dt/ = 0.05 ms, and total duration 170 ms. Stimuli were repeated 50 times and
the spike times of all \ANF and \CN units recorded.

# ** Output and Data Storage
# \yellownote{What are you doing here}

** Rate and Temporal Analysis in Amplitude Modulation

The rate measure (\rMTF) was calculated from the mean firing rate in the \PSTH,
between 20 ms and the end of the stimulus.

Temporal information was measured using the synchronisation index relative to
the modulation frequency of the stimuli.  Vector strength and Rayleigh
coefficient were also calculated to verify the \SI values using an FFT of the
period histogram.
# \SI values below 0.1 are considered insignificant.

The temporal measure used to analyse the spike output of an individual neuron
for one \AM stimulus is called the synchronization index or vector strength
\cite{GoldbergBrown:1969}.  The synchronisation index (SI) was calculated 20 ms
after the onset of the stimulus \cite{JorisSchreinerEtAl:2004}, using
Equation \ref{eq:SI}:

#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:SI} 
  SI = \frac{1}{N} \cdot \sqrt{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} x_i \right)^2 + \left(\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} y_i \right)^2 }
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX

\noindent where $x_i = \cos \theta_i$, $x_i = \sin \theta_i$, and $N$ is the
number of spike times.  Each spike is treated as a vector of unit length and
with phase $\theta_i$ between 0 and $2\pi$ measured as the spike time modulo of
the stimulus period, $1/f_m$.  Perfect synchronisation will give \SI = 1,
whereas values below 0.1 are considered insignificant.  The \SI values are
combined for each modulation frequency to create the \tMTF.

# *** The Rayleigh Test

The statistical test used for verifying the
non-uniformity of circular data is the Rayleigh statistic. The Rayleigh statistic is equivalent to a
Chi-squared test for data in uniform data and is calculated using: $2 n R^2$, where /n/ is the
number of spikes and /R/ is the vector strength.  The critical values for the
Rayleigh test are 5.991 for \alpha = 0.05, 9.21 for \alpha = 0.01, and 13.816
for \alpha = 0.001 \citep{Mardia:1972,ShannonZengEtAl:1995,MardiaJupp:1999}. 
The p-values were calculated using the equation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:p}
\exp(\sqrt{1+4n+4(n^2-R^2)}-(1+2n))
\end{equation}

(Further analysis of
the critical values see W. Rhode's analysis on the vector
strength and Rayleigh statistic[fn::
 [[http://www.neurophys.wisc.edu/comp/docs/not011/not011.html]].] )

#- A more recent study looking at another \SI verification statistic has been
#  published (need to look into this).

* Results 

** ISSNIP results

  - Note the responses in the ISSNIP data was simulated with the early Bruce model   and the \TS parameters were just the default values (equivalent to the \ChS model)

The figures below show the rate and temporal responses, across the entire
network, to an \AM tone with carrier frequency equal to the central channel's
characteristic frequency (5.82 kHz).  Modulation frequency ranged from 50 to 800
Hz.  Each figure shows the mean firing rate on the left and the synchronisation
index on the right.  The sound level of each stimulus was set to 40 dB \SPL for
the top row and 60 dB \SPL for the bottom row.

Figure \ref{fig:AM:G} shows the rate and temporal \MTF across the whole network to
AM tone centred at channel 50. The Golgi units had very low rates for 40 and 60
dB \SPL \AM tones which were limited to a narrow range around the central
channel.  The temporal response of Golgi units was almost non-existent except
for very low modulation.

  \end{figure}
#+END_LaTeX

The broad range of \CF inputs to \DS units allow for a greater likelihood of
coincident detection and an increase in synchronisation relative to the inputs.
The rate responses of \DS units (Figure \ref{fig:AM:DS}) were wider for 40 and 60
\SPL stimuli relative to the narrow band \TS units.  For 40 dB \SPL stimuli,
most \DS units had a band-pass \rMTF.  For higher \SPL, a greater number of
spikes occured between 100 and 500 Hz for units above \CF (band-pass \rMTF), but
the rest of the active units remained stable (low-pass \rMTF). This
``rate-responder'' behaviour is similar in ideal onset units in the \VCN
(octopus cells) but the cut-off of the \rMTF is much lower. The temporal
responses of \DS units were predominantly band-pass, with higher \SI values than
\ANFs.  For lower \SPL, the responses were consistent across active units with a
falling cut-off frequency with falling \CF.  For high \SPL, the \DS units were
divided along the central channel.  The \DS units above the central channel had
the strongest synchronisation and cut-off frequencies near the upper limit of
the \AN model.  The \DS units below the central channel had cut-off frequencies
around 400 Hz, similar to \TS and \TV units.

*Notes*
 - "Rate-responder" \MTF characteristics
 - Enhanced low-pass temporal \MTF
   - Near perfect synchronisation
 - Level dependent
   - Wide-band onset inhibitor
   - Golgi input suppresses saturated \AN input and provides a sustained a-phasic input of \GABA inhibition

  \end{figure}
#+END_LaTeX

The rate and temporal responses of \TV units (Figure \ref{fig:AM:TV}) showed the
non-linear effects of strong inhibition from \DS units. \TS and \TV units
received similar \ANF inputs, but the inhibition limited the activity at low
sound level and then to a narrow range at higher \SPL.  The temporal responses
of \TV units were similar to \TS units but with lesser synchronisation and
sharper cut-off.  The outer edges of active units provided the best temporal
response with little to no temporal information at the carrier frequency units.

*Notes*
 - Low rate
    - Strong \DS inhibition
 - Moderate synchronisation
    - \DS inhibition phasic
 - Level dependent

#+END_LaTeX

Figure \ref{fig:AM:TS} shows the final \MTF response of the \TS units in the
network.  The spread of excitation in \TS units was narrow around the central
channel, with greater excitation above \CF around fm=300 Hz. For higher sound
levels, the spread of excitation was wider but the rate was steadier for each
stimuli.  The significant features of the temporal responses in the right of the
figure are the very poor synchronisation in the central channel and dominant
synchronous responses at the outer edge of excitation.  For 40 dB \SPL, most
active units showed a band-pass \MTF; however, the dominant units above \CF
(channels 55 to 58) had low-pass \MTFs.  For 60 dB \SPL, most active units
showed band-pass \MTFs except for the central units, which showed limited
results or a low-pass \MTF.  Outermost active units (channels 65 to 60 and 45
to 40) had the most dominant temporal response across the \TS cell population.

- Notes
 - Sustained chopper level independent
   - \AM rate saturation of \TS units on \CF does not disable their ability to
     encode temporal information
 - Band-pass synchronisation
   - enhancement off-CF
 - Effects of inhibition
   - \DS : phasic inhibition
   - Golgi : slow level dependent
   - \TV : delayed echo suppression

* Discussion

** GLG
Golgi cells are low-firing monotonic units that influence the general
excitability of \DS and \TS units using \GABA.  The results in Figure \ref{fig:AM:G} show that the rate response to \AM tones is only dependent on
the sound level. The temporal response of the Golgi cell model is negligible.


** TV
The rate and temporal response of \TV cells was strongly inhibited by \DS units.
TV cells are thought to be responsible for delayed inhibition or
echo-suppression \citep{WickesbergOertel:1990}, but can also be involved in
tuning the temporal \MTF behaviour in \TS cells.


** DS
\yellownote{
(Joris and Smith 1998) OC cells recorded from the DAS along with type II, II and IV units in DCN, DAS of cats
AM RL < tone RL < noise RL 
AM SI-Level  maintains above 0.8 up to 60dB then slopes down to 0.6 at 80 dB, phase is linear over SPL
AM experiments are recorded using long AM stimuli, rate responses should be match to long tone responses as well (more significant for type IV)
Median maxSI = 0.93 (n=12), 3dB cutoff CFs>10kHz comparable to ANFs ~1000Hz
}


D stellate cells have an onset chopping behaviour to tones, but can follow the
repetition of amplitude modulated tones. The entrainment to the stimulus
envelope produced band-pass rate \MTFs in \DS units with a \CF above $f_c$.  The
temporal information at the channel with \CF=$f_c$ (Figure \ref{fig:AM:DS}) was
diminished by the strong GABAergic inhibition of Golgi cells; however, the
majority of active \DS units showed strong synchronisation, which suggests
synchronous tuning in \TV and \TS units throughout the \CN.


The inhomogeneous population of \TS cells are classified into different
subgroups, namely sustained or transient choppers.  Intrinsic membrane
properties and synaptic connections enable \TS units to be enhanced or tuned to
important features of the acoustic input \citep{PaoliniClareyEtAl:2005}. The
behaviour of \TS units is influenced by all three interneurons in the stellate
microcircuit.


\AM rate saturation of \TS units on \CF (Figure \ref{fig:AM:TS}) does not disable
their ability to encode temporal information.  Experimental data has shown \TS
cells generally have low-pass \MTF at low sound level and band-pass \MTF for
higher sound levels for \AM tones on \CF \citep{RhodeGreenberg:1994}.  The
implications for the \AM coding in \TS output on higher-order auditory centres
have been investigated but not fully understood
\citep{WiegrebeMeddis:2004,BahmerLangner:2006a}. A whole-network approach may
provide a stronger basis for optimal temporal coding of \AM than an approach
based solely on \CF.


* Conclusion

The \CN stellate microcircuit provides controlled and modulated enhancement of
the output of \TS cells, one of the major outputs of the cochlear nucleus.  This
paper has demonstrated the need to model detailed neural microcircuits away from
basic receptive fields of individual units.  The model has been used for
detailed optimisation \citep{EagerGraydenEtAl:2006,EagerGraydenEtAl:2007a} so
that it can be used to investigate detailed physiological properties in the \CN
stellate network.
